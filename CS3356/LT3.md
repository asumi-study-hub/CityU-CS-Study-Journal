# Project Scope Management
## Managing Software Projects

## What is Project Scope Management?

- **Project Scope**: all the works involved in creating the products of the project
  - The set of tasks/activities that you need to do to finish your project
- **Scope ≠ Requirements**
- **Project Scope ≠ Product scope**
- **Project Scope (The processes) ≠ Project Objective (Final outcome)**
- **Product scope**: the features and functions of the product or service that you and your team are building
- **Project scope ≠ Project scope management**
- **Scope creep (project)**: uncontrolled changes in scope and cause the team to do extra work and unfinished project
  - Why? A lot of uncertainties in the beginning and ... What to do? How can I complete the App?

### Example Clarification
- **Project Objective**: The objective of my final year project is to develop an app such that it can recognize image objects in real-time using mobile phones
- **Project Scope**:
  1. Review of existing real-time image objects recognition models.
  2. Converting the chosen real-time objects recognition model into a mobile platform.
  3. Design strategies to improve the performance such that it can perform in real-time.

### What is Project Scope Management?
- **Project scope management**
  - The processes for defining and controlling what is or is not included in a project
  - Why do you need to have a clear project scope? Otherwise, you may include some unnecessary tasks in your project
- **Project charter**
  - Start the project
  - rough cost and schedule estimations guided by the project management plan
- Based on the project charter
  - Refine the scope/requirement within the budgets so that the project team can make sure it is right and keep it up to date if changes are required

## Planning Scope Management (1)

- Project scope planning help you to define the roadmap (WHAT TO DO) for managing scope:
-  requirements management plan
-  scope management plan
	  - How to get and manage the requirements?
	  - How to manage the scope?
	  - Who perform the job? PM???
	- Remember: Scope ≠ Requirements
	- The scope management plan is a subsidiary part of the project management plan

### Requirements Management Plan
- requirements = "conditions or capabilities that must be met by the project or present in the product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification"
- The requirements management plan documents how (methods) project requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed
- It is helpful to divide requirements development into categories called elicitation (get), analysis, specification and validation

### Scope Management Plan Contents
- How to prepare a detailed project scope statement
  - Using templates and guidelines
- How to create a WBS (work breakdown structure)
  - Give examples
- How to maintain (update/delete) and approve the WBS
  - Guidelines and procedures
- How to obtain formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables
  - Procedures for formal approval
- How to control requests for changes to the project scope
  - Guidelines and procedures

### What Went Right?
- Projected number of jobs for business analysts expected to increase 19 percent by 2022
- Only 49 percent of survey respondents had the resources in place to do requirements management properly and 53 percent failed to use a formal process to validate requirements

### Relative Cost to Correct a Software Requirement Defect

## Collecting Requirements (2)

  - Even the users may not know exactly their own requirements
- The requirements need to be elicited (directly & indirectly), analyzed and recorded in enough details (clearly defined) to be measured once project execution starts
  - e.g., a beautiful interface. What is the meaning of a beautiful interface?
  - So, give them some examples (elicit)
- An iterative approach to defining/refining requirements since they are often unclear in the early stage of a project (uncertainty)

### Methods for Collecting Requirements
1. **Interviews**
   - Formal or informal
   - Normally one-to-one
   - Time consuming but could give more details

2. **Focus groups**
   - Bring together prequalified stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about their expectations and attributes about a proposed product, service or results

3. **Group creativity techniques**
   - Brainstorming
   - Benchmarking (comparison)
   - Generating ideas by comparing specific project practices or product characteristics to those of other projects or products inside or outside the organization

4. **Questionnaires and surveys**
   - Collect feedbacks from a large group of stakeholders efficiently
   - Require the use of statistical techniques for analysis
   - Time consuming

5. **Observation**
   - A direct way of viewing individuals in their environment and how they perform their jobs and carry out processes

6. **Prototyping and Software tools**
   - Build a simpler product first

### Documenting Requirements
- **Contents of Requirements**
  - Problems to be addressed, i.e., business needs
  - Functional requirements, i.e., features, capabilities
  - Non-functional requirements, i.e., performance, level of services, usability (quality)
  - Acceptance criteria (meeting the requirements?)
  - Operational requirements: support and administration needs
  - Deployment requirements: training needs
  - Assumptions and constraints: product related limitations

### Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a table that lists requirements, various attributes of each requirement, and the status of the requirements to ensure that all requirements are addressed
- It links the requirements to their origin and traces them throughout the project life cycle from inception to deployment
- It also facilitates the validation that approved requirements are implemented in the project results

## Defining Scope (3)

- **Requirements Vs. Scope**
  - Scope => the work to be done to meet the requirements
- Key inputs include the project charter, requirements documentation, and organizational process assets such as policies and procedures related to scope statements as well as project files and lessons learned from previous, similar projects
- As time progresses, the scope of a project should become more clear and specific (more details)
- **Note**: "As development teams, it is quite common that we DO NOT spend enough time to understand the problem, and we are too eager to develop technology-based solutions to problems we do not truly understand!!!"

### Defining Scope - Considerations
- Solutions must consider the system as a whole (individual requirement Vs. whole system)
- The problem that you are solving is being created by an existing system
- The implementation of your new system will cause behavior/operational changes, thus creating new problems and demands for new systems
  - New changes => new problems (Use walkthrough)
  - Similar to debugging a program

### Defining Scope - Actions
- Keep asking why and what the implications are
- Understand the true purpose. Is it meeting the requirement? Or because ....
- Understand the system and its environment
- Think the ultimate causes

### Defining Scope – An Iterative Process
*(Diagram showing iterative process: Requirements Development -> Customer & users needs & expectations -> Business & product requirements -> Product design tasks (SCOPE) -> Product Build)*

### Project Scope Statement
- **Output of the defining scope process**
- Project scope statement describes the deliverables, boundary, and work that will be performed to complete the product to meet the product requirements
- It defines what will be performed (included) and what will be excluded
- It includes the baseline (minimum set of tasks) to evaluate whether change requests are in scope
  - A baseline defines your scope. If a change request is received, it should be within the scope
- **Typical content**:
  - Project objectives, requirements & specifications, assumptions & constraints, deliverables, milestones (important steps), acceptance criteria (does it meet the requirements?)

### Sample Project Charter (partial)
*(Sample document showing project charter elements)*

### Further Project Scope Management
*(Additional diagrams and charts)*

### Media Snapshot
- Inaccurate requirements gathering continues to be one of the main causes of project failure
- For every dollar spent on projects and programs, 5.1 percent is wasted due to poor requirements management
- Organizations need to develop people, processes, and culture to improve requirements management

## Create WBS (4)

- **WBS (a diagram)** contains all necessary works. If it is not in WBS, it is out of scope
  - What to be done to finish the project?
  - Concretely list out the tasks within the scope
- WBS is a foundation document that provides the basis for planning and managing project schedules, costs, resources, and monitoring changes
- **Decomposition** is subdividing project deliverables into smaller pieces
  - It divides up complex deliverables or tasks and represents them as logical groups or works
  - Each level of breakdown will provide more work details
- A **work package** is a task at the lowest level of the WBS
  - The task to be performed/completed

### Sample Intranet WBS Organized by Product
*(Sample WBS diagram showing hierarchical breakdown)*

### Approaches to Developing WBS's
- How to perform WBS/divide a large task into sub-tasks?
  1. **Based on your experiences and the company standard**
     - Using guidelines: some organizations provide guidelines/templates for preparing WBS
     - The basic ways to finish a task are always similar (experiences)
  2. **The analogy approach**
     - Review WBSs of similar projects and tailor to your project
  3. **The top-down approach**
     - Start with the largest items of the project and break them down
  4. **The bottom-up approach**
     - Start with the specific tasks and roll them up

### WBS Dictionary & Scope Baseline
- Just the diagrams (why use diagrams) is not enough and unclear
- Many WBS tasks are vague and must be explained more so people know what to do and can estimate how long it will take and what it will cost to do the work
  - Remember: communication is one of the most important tasks in project management
- A **WBS dictionary** is a document that describes detailed information about each WBS item
- The approved project scope statement and its WBS and WBS dictionary form the **scope baseline**
  - Scope baseline => the set of tasks needed to be completed
  - It has to be measureable of performance in meeting project scope goals (70% of completed and 30% to be completed)

### Sample WBS Dictionary Entry
*(Sample entry showing WBS item details)*

### Advice for Creating a WBS & WBS Dictionary
1. A unit of work should appear at only one place in the WBS
2. The work content of a WBS item is the sum of the WBS items below it
   - *I.e., Defining requirements =>*
     - *Defining user requirements*
     - *Defining content requirements*
     - *Defining system requirements*
3. A WBS item is the responsibility of only one individual, even though several people may be working on it together
4. Project team members should be involved in developing the WBS to ensure consistency
5. Each WBS item must be documented in a WBS dictionary to ensure accurate understanding of the scope of work included and not included in that item
6. The WBS must be a flexible tool to accommodate changes
   - The structure can be changed
   - How? Documentation and approval for any changes
   - A change => change WBS

## Validating Scope (5)

- It is very difficult to create a good scope statement and WBS for a project
- It is even more difficult to validate project scope and minimize scope changes (deal with USERS)
- **Scope validation** involves formal acceptance of the completed project scope by the stakeholders (a lot of CONFLICTS)
  - Does the scope defined meet the requirements?
  - The users may forget what their requirements are
- Acceptance is often achieved by a customer inspection (UAT) and then sign-off on key deliverables
  - Approval from the related stakeholders
  - Can any change requests be generated after acceptance?
- **Outputs**
  - Accepted deliverable
  - Change requests: when the deliverables do not receive unconditional acceptance

## Controlling Scope (6)

- **Scope control** involves controlling changes to the project scope
  - Change requests => make changes to meet the new scope
- **Goals of scope control** are to:
  1. Influence the factors that cause scope changes
  2. Assure changes are processed according to procedures (controlled) developed as part of integrated change control
  3. Manage changes when they occur (prevent unnecessary changes)
- **Variance** is the difference between planned and actual performance
- Project performance measurements are used to assess the magnitude of variation from the original scope baseline
- Important aspects of project scope control include determining the cause and degree of variance
  - If small, accept it. If large, determine its impacts

## Best Practices for Avoiding Scope Problems

1. **Keep the scope realistic.** Don't make projects so large that they can't be completed. Break large projects down into a series of smaller ones
   - What is a realistic scope? Expert judgment/experiences
2. **Involve users in project scope management.** Assign key users to the project team and give them ownership of requirements definition and scope verification
3. **Use off-the-shelf hardware and software whenever possible.** Many IT people enjoy using the latest and greatest technology, but business needs, not technology trends, must take priority. Why?
   - Old tools Vs. New tools (choose the reliable one that you are familiar with)
4. **Follow good project management processes**

### Suggestions for Improving User Input
- Develop a good project selection process and insist that sponsors are from the user organization
- Have users on the project team in important roles
- Have regular meetings with defined agendas, and have users sign off on key deliverables presented at meetings
  - User commitment and agreement in making any decision
- Deliver something to users and sponsors on a regular basis
- Don't promise to deliver when you know you can't
- Co-locate users with developers if possible
  - Good communication channels between development team and users

### Suggestions for Reducing Incomplete & Changing Requirements
- Develop and follow a requirements management process
- Use techniques such as prototyping and use case modeling to get more user involvements
- Put requirements in writing and keep them current
- Create a requirements management database for documenting and controlling requirements
- Provide adequate testing and conduct testing throughout the project life cycle
- Review changes from a systems perspective
- Emphasize completion dates to help focus on what's most important
