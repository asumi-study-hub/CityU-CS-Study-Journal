## Managing Software Projects

## The Importance of Project Quality Management

- Many people joke about the poor quality of IT products
  - All systems have bugs
  - They are difficult to use
  - People seem to accept systems being down occasionally or needing to reboot their PCs
    - Unexpected problem, reboot or re-install the system
- But quality is very important in many IT projects
  - **Why?** Quality is part of requirements
  - Quality is also about usability, safety, reliability and security
  - What will be the consequence if some mission critical systems make mistakes? E.g., Auto-drive

## What Is Quality?

- The **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** defines quality as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements" (ISO9000:2000)
- **Other experts define quality based on**:
  1. **Conformance to requirements**: the project's processes and products meet written specifications
     - *E.g., delivery of 100 computers with specific configurations*
     - Some requirements may not come from the users but from the industry and government
  2. **Fitness for use**: a product can be used as it was intended
     - *What? Safety, reliable and easy to use*
  3. **Customer satisfaction**: making sure that the people who are paying for the end product are happy with what they get
     - But? What are they expecting?
     - Some requirements can be left unstated. They are those that are implied by the customer's explicit needs

### Importance of Meeting All Stakeholder Needs
- Many technical projects fail because the project team focuses only on meeting the written requirements for the main products being created and ignores other stakeholder needs and expectations for the project
- If a project's stakeholders are not satisfied with the quality of the project management or the resulting products of the project, the project team will need to adjust scope, time and cost to satisfy the stakeholders

### Comprehensive View of Quality
- Quality is part of requirements but is also more than requirements
- *iPhone 16 Vs. Huawei Mate XT*
  - Which one do you prefer? Which one's quality is better?
  - **Multiple quality dimensions**:
    - Functionalities
    - Easy to use
    - The interface
    - Display size and quality
    - Audio quality
    - Response time
    - Material made
    - Appearance, size and weight
    - Battery life
    - Lifespan of device
    - Failure rates
    - Inflammable, non-toxic, safety in use

## Aspects of Quality

1. **Customer focus**: companies can rely on customer feedback and satisfaction. For example, a company might design a survey system, review process or call center. Businesses can document and record customer data to track and ensure quality.

2. **Leadership**: A quality management system should include clear documentation of a company's vision and plans. This can help ensure all leaders have common goals, which can improve the efficiency of the business and the quality of products.

3. **Engagement**: All professionals within an organization work together to ensure quality. This can involve creating an employee handbook, adding professional development programs and offering opportunities for open communication between employees and management.

4. **Process**: A business can use processes to lower costs, improve efficiency and ensure quality. A quality management system should include plans for processes. For example, a production process plan is part of an organization's QMS. It details how the company creates products to ensure efficiency and quality.

5. **Improvement**: A business can focus on continuous improvements. Business leaders may design strategies and processes, such as internal reviews. They can also refine and revise their business strategies, including marketing campaigns and production processes. A quality management system should measure and track these improvements. For example, if a manager wants to improve the production time to increase efficiency, they could measure the current production time and track it over time.

6. **Relationship management**: The final principle in quality management is relationship management. This involves how a business interacts with others, including suppliers, investors, employees and customers. To build successful relationships, business leaders can gather and share information with the relevant parties.

## Scope Aspects of IT Projects

- **Functionality/Features** are the system's special characteristics that appeal to users
- **System outputs** are the screens and reports the system generates
- **Performance** addresses how well a product or service performs the customer's intended use
- **Reliability** is the ability of a product or service to perform as expected under normal conditions
- **Maintainability** addresses the ease of performing maintenance on a product
- **Security and privacy**

## Why Quality is So Important

- If a business can create and distribute high-quality goods and services, then it is more likely to be a successful enterprise. **Why?**

1. **Lead the industry**: Businesses with the best quality items become industry leaders and set the standard for other businesses in the market to follow.

2. **Increase customer loyalty**: If a business' product meets and exceeds the customer's expectations, then it is highly likely that the customer will continue to purchase that product.

3. **Build a reputation**: Good quality products will achieve positive reviews from customers. In today's technologically advanced world, social media reviews can help boost a business' traffic and orders.

4. **Manage costs**: Companies track all profits and costs related to producing a product. Good quality products and services should be able to lower production costs and increase profit margins.

## Who's Responsible for the Quality of Projects?

- Project managers are ultimately responsible for quality management on their projects. **How?**
- Several organizations and references can help project managers, and their teams understand quality
  - **International Organization for Standardization** (www.iso.org)
  - **IEEE** (www.ieee.org)

### Industrial Quality Standard
- The type of quality management system you use can depend upon your industry
- Companies may design their own quality management systems, or pursue certification through the ISO, by meeting their standard systems
  - **ISO 9001**: This is the most common type of quality management system. Companies in many industries use this system, including construction, manufacturing and business. It involves improving efficiency and production quality.
  - **IATF 16949**: Companies in the automotive industry can use this quality management system. It focuses on improving the production and supply process in automobile production.
  - **ISO 22000**: This is the standard quality management system for food production companies. It specifies production and distribution guidelines to ensure food safety.
  - **ISO 27001**: Information technology companies can use this standard to ensure the quality and safety of information networks.

## What Is Project Quality Management?

- Project quality management ensures that the project will satisfy the needs/requirements (stated and unstated) for which it was undertaken
  - From the users, customers, company, government, society ...
- **Processes include**:
  1. **Plan quality**: identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project and how to satisfy them; choose and define a metric which is a standard of measurement
  2. **Control quality**: monitoring specific project results/deliverables to ensure that they comply with the relevant quality standards
  3. **Manage quality**: periodically evaluating overall project process performance to ensure the project and product will satisfy the relevant quality standards

### Project Quality Management Summary
*(Diagram showing quality management processes)*

## Plan Quality (1)

- Create a quality management plan to help guide you and your team quality activities (what to do in quality management?)
- Focus on taking all the information available to you at the beginning of the project and figuring out how you will measure your quality and prevent defects
- **Metrics/measures** tell what and how you are going to measure your product's quality
- It includes the guidelines and standard (from the organization, industry and government) for managing quality on your project, your strategies for monitoring your project quality, and the metrics being used to judge success or failure of the project
- Identify the key factors that directly contribute to meeting the customer's requirements
  - **Internal**: your company should have a quality policy that tells how it measures quality across organization
  - **External**: any governmental rules or regulations on how you need to plan quality for your project

### How to Plan for Quality
1. **Data gathering**
   - **Benchmarking**: Using the results of Plan Quality on other projects to set goals for your project
   - **Brainstorming**
   - **Interviews**: the people participating the project have a lot of information from their experience that can help planning quality management

2. **Data analysis**
   - **Cost of quality (vs risk management)**: add up the cost of all the prevention and inspection activities that you are going to do on your project. It includes times for writing standards, reviewing documents, meeting to analyze the roots cause of defects.
   - **Cost-benefit analysis**: How much your quality activities will cost versus how much you will gain from doing them. What are the benefits?

3. **Expert judgement**: external people with expertise and getting their help

4. **Decision making**: analyze multiple issues and prioritize so that you can work on the most important ones first (cost Vs. benefits)

5. **Test planning**: apply scientific/statistical method to create a set of tests for your project's deliverable. Analyze the results of your experiments to determine how your deliverables best meet the requirements

6. **Data representation**
   - Flowcharts, Tables, spreadsheets

7. **Meetings**: Figure out how your team will do all the quality-related activities your project required

## Manage Quality (2)

- It is not enough to inspect your deliverables. Sometimes it is the way you work that is causing your problem. That is why you need to spend some time thinking about how you will make sure you are doing the work efficiently and with as few defects as possible
- **Quality assurance** is used to describe the activities related to satisfying the relevant quality standards/requirements for a project
- In the **Manage Quality process**, you take all the outputs from the Plan Quality Management and Control Quality (find the problems) and look at them to see if you can find ways to improve the process
- **Tools**:
  - Plan Quality Management tools and techniques
  - Control Quality tools and techniques
  - Quality improvement methods
  - Problem solving
  - Quality audits

### Quality Audits
- Quality audit are when your company reviews your project to see if you are following its processes. The purpose is to figure out if there are ways to help you to be more effective by finding stuff you are doing on your project that is inefficient or cause defects
- A lot of companies have **Quality Assurance Department** whose job is to perform these audits and report findings from projects to a process group

### Quality Management and Control Tools
- E.g., If you created a Pareto chart that showed all the defects in all your projects, you could find the one or two categories of defects that caused problems for the whole company

### Pareto Charts
- A **Pareto chart** is a (sorted) histogram that can help you identify and prioritize problem areas
- **Pareto analysis** is also called the **80-20 rule**, meaning that 80 percent of problems are often due to 20 percent of the causes
*(Example Pareto chart)*

## Control Quality (3)

- The monitoring and control process where you look at each deliverable and inspect for defects
- It is not good enough to inspect the final product. You must look at all the things that you make throughout a project to find bugs (and errors).
- You look at the work performance information that is coming from your project and compare it to your plan. If there are problems, you recommend a change to make sure that it does not happen again
- **The main outputs of quality control are**:
  - Quality control measurements
  - Verified deliverables and validated changes
  - Change requests
  - Work performance information

### Tools for Data Gathering
- **Checksheets**: allow you to collect data on the product under test. They are used for gathering the data that is displayed in trending and charting tools
- **Statistical sampling** (e.g., embedded devices):
  - You look at a representative sample of something to make decision
  - Help you make decisions about your product without looking at each and everything you make
  - Sampling size??
- **Questionnaires and survey**: used to gather feedback from customers when they have some time to use the product
- **Meeting**

### Checksheets Example
*(Sample checksheet form)*

### Tools for Data Analysis
- Analyze the gathered data and look for differences between what you expected when you planned the project and how it currently perform
- **Performance review**
  - How you and your team will evaluate the current measurements of your product's quality in comparison to the measurements you expected to see
- **Root cause analysis**
  - It is all about evaluating the product your project is creating to understand why defects are occurring. You need to trace it back to the thing that caused it. Ask WHY?!

### Inspection, Testing and Product Evaluation
- As soon as you create deliverables on your project, your team inspects, tests, and evaluates them to make sure that they are meeting the standards you set when you were planning
- **Inspection**
  - Comparing the deliverables in your project to the standard (or previous versions) you have created for them.
  - If deliverables do not meet your project's standard, you have found a defect
  - It is not just the product of your project that get inspected. You can inspect any interim deliverable. The sooner you inspect and find defects in a deliverable the less expensive it is to fix
- **Testing/product evaluation**
  - They are planned as part of the Plan Quality process. As new deliverables are made available throughout the project, the team tests them to understand how much they conform to the requirements that have been defined up front.

### Tools for Data Representation
- Once you have gathered data and analyzed it, you will need to show the data to other people to help drive decisions.
- The tools for data representation help visualize your data that everyone in your project can use it to get a handle on quality in your project
- E.g., Histograms give you a good idea on how your data breaks down.

### Cause-and-Effect Diagrams
- **Cause-and-effect diagrams** trace complaints about quality problems back to the responsible production operations
- They help you find the root cause of a problem
- Also known as **fishbone** or **Ishikawa diagrams**
- They help you see all the possible causes in one place so you can think of how you might prevent the defect in the future

### Sample Cause-and-Effect Diagram
*(Fishbone diagram example)*

### Quality Control Charts
- A **control chart** is a graphic display of data that illustrates the results of a process over time
- Quality control charts allow you to determine whether a process is in control or out of control
- **When a process is in control**, any variations in the results of the process are created by random events; processes that are in control do not need to be adjusted
- **When a process is out of control**, variations in the results of the process are caused by non-random events; you need to identify the causes of those non-random events and adjust the process to correct or eliminate them

### The Seven Run Rule
- You can use quality control charts and the seven run rule to look for patterns in data
- **The seven run rule** states that if seven data points in a row are all below the mean, above the mean, or are all increasing or decreasing, then the process needs to be examined for non-random problems

## Testing

- Many IT professionals think of testing as a stage that comes near the end of IT product development
- **Testing should be done during almost every phase of the IT product development life cycle**

### Testing Tasks in the Software Development Life Cycle
*(Diagram showing testing throughout SDLC)*

### Types of Tests
1. **Unit testing**: tests each individual component (often a program) to ensure it is as defect-free as possible
2. **Integration testing**: occurs between unit and system testing to test functionally grouped components
3. **System testing**: tests the entire system as one entity
4. **User acceptance testing**: is an independent test performed by end users prior to accepting the delivered system

## Modern Quality Management

- **Modern quality management**:
  - Requires customer satisfaction
  - Prefers prevention to inspection
  - Recognizes management responsibility for quality

### Improving Information Technology Project Quality
- Suggestions for improving quality for IT projects include:
  1. Establish leadership that promotes quality
  2. Understand the cost/benefits of quality management
  3. Focus on organizational influences and workplace factors that affect quality
  4. Follow maturity models (E.g., Total Quality Management and Six Sigma)

### The Cost of Quality
- The **cost of quality** is the cost of conformance plus the cost of nonconformance
  - **Conformance** means delivering products that meet requirements and fitness for use
  - **Cost of nonconformance** means taking responsibility for failures or not meeting quality expectations
- A study reported that software bugs cost the U.S. economy $59.6 billion each year and that one third of the bugs could be eliminated by an improved testing infrastructure

### Five Cost Categories Related to Quality
1. **Prevention cost**: cost of planning and executing a project so it is error-free or within an acceptable error range
2. **Appraisal cost**: cost of evaluating processes and their outputs to ensure quality
3. **Internal failure cost**: cost incurred to correct an identified defect before the customer receives the product
4. **External failure cost**: cost that relates to all errors not detected and corrected before delivery to the customer
5. **Measurement and test equipment costs**: capital cost of equipment used to perform prevention and appraisal activities

### Organizational Influences, Workplace Factors, and Quality
- Organizational issues had a much greater influence on programmer productivity than the technical environment or programming languages
- Programmer productivity varied by a factor of one to ten across organizations, but only by 21 percent within the same organization
- Study found no correlation between productivity and programming language, years of experience, or salary
- A dedicated workspace and a quiet work environment were key factors to improving programmer productivity

### Expectations and Cultural Differences in Quality
- Project managers must understand and manage stakeholder expectations
- Expectations also vary by:
  - Organization's culture
  - Geographic regions

## Chapter Summary

- Project quality management ensures that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken
- **Main processes include**:
  1. Plan quality
  2. Manage quality
  3. Control quality
