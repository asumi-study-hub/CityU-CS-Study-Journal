# Project Cost Management
## Managing Software Projects

## The Importance of Project Cost Management
- difficult to perform estimations and control for IT projects
  - Changing technologies and lack of previous and similar projects
  - Unknown user requirements
  - Many IT PM are not so good in managing money/cost

## What is Cost and Project Cost Management?

- **Cost ≠ Cost management**
- **Cost** is a resource sacrificed to achieve a specific objective or something given up in exchange
  - Not just money but include many others, i.e., fixed assets
  - Costs are usually measured in monetary units
- **Project cost management**
  - The processes required to ensure that the project is completed within an approved budget
  - Is it good to complete it well below the budget?
- The budget is initially defined in the project charter and is refined during the planning, monitoring and controlling processes (similar to deadline)

## Project Cost Management Processes

1. **Planning cost management (Planning)**
   - Determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost

2. **Estimating costs (Planning)**
   - Developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to complete a project

3. **Determining the budget (Planning)**
   - Allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance

4. **Controlling costs (Monitoring and Controlling)**
   - Controlling changes to the project budget

## Basic Principles of Cost Management

 - Gain or loss? Success or fail? Spend more or less?
- Main goal of a business => survival of a business => maximize profits (short term and long term)
  - **Profits**: revenues – expenditures (R – E)
  - **Profit margin**: the ratio of profits over expenditures (R – E)/E
- **Life cycle costing**: the total cost of ownership, or development plus support/operation costs, for a project.
  - *I.e., development $10million and support cost $100,000 each year for 10 years*
- **Cash flow analysis**: the estimated annual costs and benefits for a project and the resulting annual cash flow (cash over time)

### Types of Costs
- **Tangible costs or benefits** are those costs or benefits that an organization can easily measure in dollars
  - *I.e. purchasing equipment for a project*
- **Intangible costs or benefits** are costs or benefits that are difficult to measure in monetary terms (how to calculate?)
  - *I.e., company image, experiences ...*
- **Direct costs** are costs that can be directly related to producing the products and services of the project
- **Indirect costs** are costs that are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project (how to allocate?)
- **Sunk cost** is money that has been spent in the past; when deciding what projects to invest in or continue, you should not include sunk costs
- **Total cost**: tangible + intangible + direct + indirect

### Additional Principles
- **Learning curve theory** states that when many items are produced repetitively, the unit cost of the items decreases
  - Producing one unit is expensive but one million could be very cheap
  - *I.e., Cost = fixed cost + variable cost x number of units*
  - How many units to be produced? Supply Vs. demand
- **Reserves** are dollars included in a cost estimate to mitigate cost risk for future situations that are difficult to predict
  - **Contingency reserves** allow for future situations that may be partially planned for (sometimes called known unknowns) and are included in the project cost baseline
  - **Management reserves** allow for future situations that are unpredictable (sometimes called unknown unknowns)


## Planning Cost Management (1)

- The project team uses expert judgment, analytical techniques, and meetings to develop the cost management plan (how to manage the cost?)
- **A cost management plan includes**:
  - Level of accuracy and units of measure
  - Organizational procedure links
  - Control thresholds
  - Rules of performance measurement
  - Reporting formats
  - Process descriptions

## Estimating Costs (2)

- **Project managers**:
  - Given the initial budget in the project charter and initial schedule, the project manager estimate the total cost for the project
  - Not enough? Negotiate with the stakeholders?
- **Note**: A lot of times, you come into a project and there is already an expectation of how much it will cost or how much time it will take. For these cases, they are your targets
- Although all resources can be converted to monetary unit, but how to do the conversion?
  - Different types of resources have different characteristics
  - Labor cost, depreciation, etc., ...
  - Follow pre-defined guidelines or standard used
- Costs need to be spread over time (cash flow and resource allocation)
  - Budget (over time) Vs. Schedule

### Types of Cost Estimates
*(Illustration showing evolution of cost estimates)*
*Depending on the availability of information*
*Initiating → Planning → Executing ↔ Controlling and Monitoring*

### Cost Estimation Tools & Techniques
1. **Top-down estimates**
   - Use the actual cost of a previous, similar project as the basis for estimating the cost of the current project

2. **Bottom-up estimates**
   - Involve estimating individual work items or activities (i.e. those in the WBS) and summing them to get a project total

3. **Parametric modeling**
   - Uses project characteristics (parameters) in a mathematical model to estimate project costs
   - Defining a cost model using well-accepted formula and inputting parameters to get the cost
   - *I.e., total cost = 100 x a + 200 x b*
   - Changing parameters to obtain a new cost

### Typical Problems with IT Cost Estimates
1. **Estimates are done too quickly**
   - Go into the details to estimate the cost for each task
   - Always ask yourself, can I go further details? Anything missing?
   - Ask other people for suggestion
   - Look at similar projects

2. **Lack of experience**
   - Cost for similar project could be very different at different times
   - New tools and new equipment, changing costs
   - Experiences could be harmful! Why?

3. **Human beings are biased toward underestimation**
   - Project managers tend to underestimate
   - Team members tend to overestimate

4. **"Management desires accuracy and realistic estimations"**. How?

### Sample Cost Estimate
**Surveyor Pro Software Development Estimate**
- Cost estimate for the Surveyor Pro project
- Before creating an estimate, clarify the ground rules and assumptions for the estimate
- If possible, estimate costs by major WBS categories
  - Smaller units can give a better estimation
- Create a cost model (uses some rules and formulae with assumptions) to make it easier to make changes and document the estimate
  - Making assumptions
  - Defining rules, principles and some formulae for estimations

## Determining the Budget (4)

- **Cost budgeting** involves allocating the project cost estimate to individual work items over time
  - Ensure sufficient resources for each task at the time when it is started
- The inputs to cost budgeting are similar to those in cost estimating with the additions of activity cost estimates and basis of estimates
  - Where are these two come from?
- The WBS is a required input to the cost budgeting process since it defines the work items
- Important goal is to produce a **cost baseline**
  - A time-phased budget that project managers use to measure and monitor cost performance

### Surveyors Pro Software Cost Baseline

*Define how much money/resources you need at each period of time*

## Controlling Costs

- **Project cost control** includes:
  1. Monitoring cost performance (spent Vs. planned)
     - Do you spend more than your planned?
  2. Ensuring that only appropriate project changes are included in a revised cost baseline
     - How to ensure? Cost change control
     - A change in scope => a change in cost
     - If yes, generate a change request which needs to be approved
     - With an approved change request makes change to be baselines and update project plan

### Tools and Techniques for Cost Control
1. **Cost change control system**
   - A set of defined procedures for making cost change

2. **Performance measurement analysis**
   - Measure how your project is doing compared to the plan

3. **Variance analysis**
   - Identify the reasons between planned and actual performance

4. **Project performance reviews**
   - Review meetings to examine the variances

5. **Forecasting**
   - Based on the current and the changes to predict the future

## Earned Value Management (EVM)

- **EVM** is a project performance measurement technique that integrates scope, time, and cost data
- Given a baseline (original plan plus approved changes), you can determine how well the project is meeting its goals
- You must enter actual information periodically (control and monitoring) to use EVM
  - Compare the actual statues with the planned
- More and more organizations around the world are using EVM to help control project costs
  - To examine the current status and predict the future

### Key EVM Metrics
- **Planned Value (PV)**, also called the budget, is that portion of the approved total cost estimate planned to be spent on an activity during a given period
  - PV = BAC (budget at completion) × planned % completed
  - BAC is the agreed amount (originally planned) for the whole project
  - *I.e., $100,000 to upgrade 100 PCs in 4 weeks. After two week, 40 PCs are upgraded. Then, the PV = $100,000 × 50% = $50,000*
  - The sponsors expect that after 2 weeks the value of the percentages of work done should be 2/4 = 50%
  - So, you can obtain PV once you have determined BAC and the project schedule

- **Earned Value (EV)**, is an estimate of the value of the physical work actually completed
  - EV = BAC × actual % completed
  - *I.e., $100,000 to upgrade 100 PCs in 4 weeks. After two week, 40 PCs are upgraded. Then, the EV = $100,000 × 40% = $40,000*
  - The sponsors consider the whole project worth $100,000. So, the amount of value earned at the moment is $40,000
  - But, how much have they invested? The actual cost could be higher than $40,000

### Schedule Performance Metrics
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**
  - SPI = EV/PV
  - If SPI is greater than one, the project is ahead of schedule

- **Schedule Variance (SV)**
  - SV = EV – PV
  - If the variance is positive, it tells you how much money you are ahead

- **Estimate Time to Complete (ETC)**
  - Original time to complete / SPI
  - If SPI is greater than one, the completion time of the project will be earlier than the original time to complete

### Cost Performance Metrics
- **Actual Cost (AC)**
  - The total of direct and indirect costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during a given period

- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**
  - CPI = EV / AC
  - If CPI < 1, it means you are over-budget
  - The value earned is smaller than what you have spent

- **Cost Variance (CV)**
  - CV = EV – AC
  - If CV is negative, then your project is not getting good value for the money spent

- **Estimate at Completion (EAC)**
  - EAC = AC / actual % completed
  - EAC = BAC/CPI

- **Variance at Completion (VAC)**
  - BAC – EAC

### Earned Value Formulas Summary
*(Table showing key EVM formulas)*
*Note: You DO NOT need to remember the equations*

### Keep Your Project On Track
- **To-complete performance index (TCPI)**
  - It represents a target that your CPI would have to hit in order to hit your forecast completion cost
  - **TCPI = (BAC – EV) / (BAC – AC)**
    - How much budgeted work is left divided by how much budgeted money is left
    - You are trying to get your project within your original budget
  - **TCPI = (BAC – EV) / (EAC – AC)**
    - How much budgeted work is left divided by how much estimated money is left
    - You are trying to get your project done within the EAC that you have determined from earned value calculations
  - A high TCPI means a tight budget

### TCPI Examples
1. **Example 1**:
   - BAC is $40,000 and EAC is $40,000, EV is $17,000 and AC is $15,000. What is BAC-based TCPI?
   - TCPI = (BAC – EV) / (BAC – AC) = (40000 – 17000) / (40000 – 15000)
   - TCPI = 23000/25000 = 0.92 (original budget)

2. **Example 2**:
   - BAC is $100,000 and EAC is $107,000, EV is $68,000 and AC is $70,000. What is EAC-based TCPI?
   - TCPI = (BAC – EV) / (EAC – AC) = (100000 – 68000) / (107000 – 70000)
   - TCPI = 32000 / 37000 = 0.86 (estimate at completion)

3. **Example 3**:
   - BAC is 20,000, EAC is 20000, AC is 15,000, and the project is 75% complete. What is the EAC-based TCPI?
   - EV = 20000 × 0.75 = 15000
   - TCPI = (BAC – EV) / (EAC – AC) = (20000 – 15000) / (20000 – 15000) = 1

### Rules of Thumbs for Earned Value
- Negative numbers for cost and schedule variance indicate problems in those areas
- CPI and SPI less than 100% indicate problems
- Problems mean the project is costing more than planned (over budget) or taking longer than planned (behind schedule)
- The CPI can be used to calculate the estimate at completion (EAC), an estimate of what it will cost to complete the project based on performance to date
- The budget at completion (BAC) is the original total budget for the project

### Earned Value Chart for Project after Five Months
*(Graph showing EV, PV, and AC over time)*

### Example EVM Calculation
**Scenario**: Your project has a total budget of $300,000. You check your records and find that you have spent $175,000 so far. The team has completed 40% of the project work, but when you check the schedule it says that they should have competed 50% of the work

**Calculations**:
- BAC = $300,000
- PV = BAC × planned % completed = $300,000 × 50% = $150,000
- AC = $175,000
- EV = BAC × actual % completed = $300,000 × 40% = $120,000
- SV = EV – PV = 120,000 – 150,000 = $-30,000
- CV = EV – AC = 120,000 – 175,000 = $-55,000
- SPI = EV/PV = 120,000/150,000 = 0.8
- CPI = EV/AC = 120,000/175,000 = 0.68
