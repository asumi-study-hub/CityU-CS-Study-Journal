# Project Stakeholder Management
## Managing Software Projects

## Importance of Project Stakeholder Management

- **The purpose of project stakeholder management** is to identify all people or organizations affected by a project, to analyze stakeholder expectations, and to effectively engage stakeholders

### Projects Often Cause Change
- Projects often cause changes in organizations, and some people may lose their jobs when a project is completed. Project managers might be viewed as enemies if the project resulted in job losses for some stakeholders
- By contrast, they could be viewed as allies if they lead a project that helps increase profits, produce new jobs, or increase pay for certain stakeholders
- In any case, project managers must learn to identify, understand, and work with a variety of stakeholders

## Project Stakeholder Management Processes

1. **Identifying stakeholders**: Identifying everyone involved in the project or affected by it, and determining the best ways to manage relationships with them.
2. **Planning stakeholder management**: Determining strategies to effectively engage stakeholders
3. **Managing stakeholder engagement**: Communicating and working with project stakeholders to satisfy their needs and expectations, resolving issues, and fostering engagement in project decisions and activities
4. **Monitoring stakeholder engagement**: Monitoring stakeholder relationships and adjusting plans and strategies for engaging stakeholders as needed

## Identifying Stakeholders (1)

- **Internal project stakeholders** generally include:
  - Project sponsor
  - Project team
  - Support staff
  - Internal customers for the project
  - Other internal stakeholders include top management, other functional managers, and other project managers because organizations have limited resources
- **External project stakeholders** include:
  - Project's customers (if they are external to the organization)
  - Competitors
  - Suppliers
  - Other external groups that are potentially involved in the project or affected by it, such as government officials and concerned citizens

### Additional Stakeholders
- Other stakeholders including:
  - Program director
  - Project manager's family (maybe)
  - Labor unions (maybe)
  - Potential customers
- It is also necessary to focus on stakeholders with the most direct ties to a project, for example only key suppliers

### Stakeholder Register
- A **stakeholder register** includes basic information on stakeholders:
  1. **Identification information**: The stakeholders' names, positions, locations, roles in the project, and contact information
  2. **Assessment information**: The stakeholders' major requirements and expectations, potential influences, and phases of the project in which stakeholders have the most interest
  3. **Stakeholder classification**: Is the stakeholder internal or external to the organization? Is the stakeholder a supporter of the project or resistant to it?

### Sample Stakeholder Register

### Classifying Stakeholders
- After identifying key project stakeholders, you can use different classification models to determine an approach for managing stakeholder relationships
- A **power/interest grid** can be used to group stakeholders based on their level of authority (power) and their level of concern (interest) for project outcomes

### Power/Interest Grid
*(Grid showing four quadrants: High Power/High Interest, High Power/Low Interest, Low Power/High Interest, Low Power/Low Interest)*

### Stakeholder Engagement Levels
1. **Unaware**: Unaware of the project and its potential impacts on them
2. **Resistant**: Aware of the project yet resistant to change
3. **Neutral**: Aware of the project yet neither supportive nor resistant
4. **Supportive**: Aware of the project and supportive of change
5. **Leading**: Aware of the project and its potential impacts and actively engaged in helping it succeed

## Plan Stakeholder Management (2)

- After identifying and analyzing stakeholders, project teams should develop a plan for managing them
- **The stakeholder management plan can include**:
  - Current and desired engagement levels
  - Interrelationships between stakeholders
  - Communication requirements
  - Potential management strategies for each stakeholder
  - Methods for updating the stakeholder management plan

### Sensitive Information
- Because a stakeholder management plan often includes sensitive information, it should not be part of the official project documents, which are normally available for all stakeholders to review
- In many cases, only project managers and a few other team members should prepare the stakeholder management plan
- Parts of the stakeholder management plan are not written down, and if they are, distribution is strictly limited

### Sample Stakeholder Analysis

## Manage Stakeholder Engagement (3)

- Project success is often measured in terms of customer/sponsor satisfaction
- Project sponsors often rank scope, time, and cost goals in order of importance and provide guidelines on how to balance the triple constraint
- This ranking can be shown in an **expectations management matrix** to help clarify expectations

### Expectations Management Matrix
*(Matrix showing project constraints ranked by priority)*

### Issue Logs
- Understanding the stakeholders' expectations can help in managing issues
- **Issues** should be documented in an **issue log**, a tool used to document, monitor, and track issues that need resolution
- Unresolved issues can be a major source of conflict and result in stakeholder expectations not being met
- Issue logs can address other knowledge areas as well

### Sample Issue Log

### Best Practice
- Project managers are often faced with challenges, especially in managing stakeholders
- Sometimes they simply cannot meet requests from important stakeholders
- **Suggestions for handling these situations include the following**:
  1. Be clear from the start
  2. Explain the consequences
  3. Have a contingency plan
  4. Avoid surprises
  5. Take a stand

### What Went Right?
- Instead of just saying "no" when your project sponsor asks for something unreasonable, it is better to explain what is wrong with the request and then present a realistic way to solve the problem at hand
- For example, Christa Ferguson, a PMP and independent program manager in San Francisco, described how she handled a request from a project sponsor to deliver a new tablet device in two months when she knew she would need more time. Based on her experience, she knew the RFQ for the effort alone would take almost a month. Christa quickly researched the facts to propose a realistic delivery schedule.
- The project sponsor reset expectations once he learned what it took to produce the tablets

## Monitoring Stakeholder Engagement

- You cannot control stakeholders, but you can monitor their level of engagement
- **Engagement** involves a dialogue in which people seek understanding and solutions to issues of mutual concern
- Many teachers are familiar with various techniques for engaging students
- It is important to set the proper tone at the start of a class or project

### Example of Engaging or Not Engaging Students (or Other Stakeholders)
- If a teacher (or manager) does nothing but lecture on the first day of class (or at meetings) or criticizes the first person who offers a comment, students (or workers) will quickly decide that their best strategy is to keep quiet and maybe not even attend the class (or meetings)
- On the other hand, if the teacher (or manager) uses a lot of activities to get all participants to speak or use technology to participate, they will expect to be active participants in future classes (or meetings)

### Ways to Monitor Engagement
1. Key stakeholders should be invited to actively participate in a kick-off meeting rather than merely attending it
2. The project manager should emphasize that a dialogue is expected at the meeting, including texts or whatever means of communication the stakeholders prefer. The project manager should also meet with important stakeholders before the kick-off meeting
3. The project schedule should include activities and deliverables related to stakeholder engagement, such as surveys, reviews, demonstrations, and sign-offs.

### Stakeholders As Key Project Team Members
- On some IT projects, important stakeholders are invited to be members of the project teams
- For example, when Northwest Airlines (now Delta) was developing a new reservation system called ResNet, it interviewed reservation agents for positions as programmers on the project team
- Northwest made sure that user needs were understood by having them actually develop the system's user interface
