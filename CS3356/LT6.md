# Chapter 6: The Project Management Process Groups
## Managing Software Projects

## Project Management Process Groups

- A **process** is a series of actions directed toward a particular result
- Project management can be viewed as a number of interlinked processes
- **The project management process groups include**:
  1. **Initiating processes**
  2. **Planning processes**
  3. **Executing processes**
  4. **Monitoring and controlling processes**
  5. **Closing processes**


## Mapping the Process Groups to the Knowledge Areas

- You can map the main activities of each PM process group into the ten knowledge areas using the PMBOK®
- Note that there are activities from each knowledge area under the planning process group

### Project Management Process Groups and Knowledge Area Mapping*

## Developing an IT Project Management Methodology

- Just as projects are unique, so are approaches to project management
- Many organizations develop their own project management methodologies, especially for IT projects
- A **methodology** describes *how* things should be done; a **standard** describes *what* should be done
- **PRINCE2, Agile, RUP, and Six Sigma** provide different project management methodologies

## Case Study: JWD Consulting's Project Management Intranet Site

- This case study provides an example of what's involved in initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing an IT project

## Project Pre-initiation

- It is good practice to lay the groundwork for a project before it officially starts
- **Senior managers often perform several pre-initiation tasks**, including the following:
  1. Determine the scope, time, and cost constraints for the project
  2. Identify the project sponsor
  3. Select the project manager
  4. Develop a business case for a project
  5. Meet with the project manager to review the process and expectations for managing the project
  6. Determine if the project should be divided into two or more smaller projects

## Project Initiation

- Initiating a project includes recognizing and starting a new project
- **The main goal is to formally select and start off projects**

### Project Stakeholder
- **Stakeholder Register** - Document identifying project stakeholders

### Stakeholder Management Strategy
- Contents are often sensitive, so do not publish this document.

## Project Charters and Kick-off Meetings

- Charters are normally short and include key project information and stakeholder signatures
- It's good practice to hold a **kick-off meeting** at the beginning of a project so that stakeholders can meet each other, review the goals of the project, and discuss future plans

### Kick-off Meeting Agenda
*(Sample agenda items for a project kick-off meeting)*

## Project Planning

- The main purpose of project planning is to guide execution
- Every knowledge area includes planning information
- **Key outputs included in the JWD project include**:
  - A team contract
  - A project scope statement
  - A work breakdown structure (WBS)
  - A project schedule, in the form of a Gantt chart with all dependencies and resources entered
  - A list of prioritized risks (part of a risk register)

## Project Executing

- Usually takes the most time and resources to perform project execution
- Project managers must use their leadership skills to handle the many challenges (conflicts) that occur during project execution
- Many project sponsors and customers focus on deliverables related to providing the products, services, or results desired from the project
- A **milestone report** can help focus on completing major milestones

### Part of Milestone Report (Table 3-12)
*(Sample milestone report showing project progress)*

## Project Monitoring and Controlling

- Involves measuring progress toward project objectives, monitoring deviation from the plan, and taking correction actions
- Affects all other process groups and occurs during all phases of the project life cycle
- **Outputs include**:
  - Performance reports
  - Change requests
  - Updates to various plans

## Project Closing

- Involves gaining stakeholder and customer acceptance of the final products and services
- Even if projects are not completed, they should be closed out to learn from the past
- **Outputs include**:
  - Project archives
  - Lessons learned (part of organizational process assets)
- Most projects also include a final report and presentation to the sponsor/senior management

## Chapter Summary

- The five project management process groups are initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing
- You can map the main activities of each process group to the ten knowledge areas
- Some organizations develop their own information technology project management methodologies
- The JWD Consulting case study provides an example of using the process groups and shows several important project documents
