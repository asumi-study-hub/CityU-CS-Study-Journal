## Managing Software Projects

## Importance of Project Procurement Management

- **Procurement** means acquiring goods and/or services from an outside source
- Other terms include **purchasing** and **outsourcing**
- Experts predict that global spending on computer software and services will continue to grow
- Many IT projects involve the use of goods and services from outside the organization
- Garner (survey company) the global IT spending in 2019 reached $3.9 trillion
- People continue to debate whether offshore outsourcing helps their own country or not

### Debates on Outsourcing
- Some companies, such as Wal-Mart, prefer to do no outsourcing at all, while others do a lot of outsourcing. GM recently announced plans to switch from outsourcing 90% of IT service to only 10%
- Most organizations do some form of outsourcing to meet their IT needs and spend most money within their own country

### IT Outsourcing Market Continues to Grow
- U.S. companies are transferring more work abroad, especially in the areas of IT infrastructure, application development and maintenance, and innovation processes
- India, China, and the Philippines are the preferred locations for outsourcing, and Latin America is growing in popularity
- A shortage of qualified personnel, not cost savings, is the top reason for global outsourcing of IT services

## Why Outsourcing?

1. **To access skills and technologies**
   - Specific and various skills in IT industry

2. **To reduce both fixed and recurrent costs**
   - Outsourcing can use economies of scale
   - Reduce labor costs by avoiding the costs of hiring, firing, and reassigning people to projects or paying their salaries when they are between projects

3. **To allow the client organization to focus on its core business**
   - Many organizations are not in business to provide IT services

4. **To provide flexibility**
   - Provide extra staff during periods of peak workload
   - Flexibility in staffing

5. **To increase accountability**
   - A well-written contract is a mutual binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide specified products or services

## Why Not Outsource?

1. **Less control** over the aspects of projects that suppliers carry out

2. **Could be too dependent on particular suppliers**
   - If the suppliers went out of business or lost key personnel, it could cause great damage to a project

3. **Organizations must be careful to protect strategic information** that could be vulnerable in the hand of suppliers

4. **To increase accountability?**
   - A well-written contract is a mutual binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide specified products or services

5. **Additional cost and workload** for preparing, selecting and controlling procurement and contracts

### Contracts
- A **contract** is a mutually binding agreement that obligates the seller to provide the specified products or services and obligates the buyer to pay for them
- Contracts (well-prepared) can clarify responsibilities and sharpen focus on key deliverables of a project
- Because contracts are legally binding, there is more accountability for delivering the work as stated in the contract

## Project Procurement Management Processes

- **Project procurement management**: Acquiring goods and services for a project from outside the performing organization
- **Processes include**:
  1. **Planning procurement management**: Determining what to procure and when and how to do it
  2. **Conducting procurements**: Obtaining seller responses, selecting sellers, and awarding contracts
  3. **Controlling procurements**: Managing relationships with sellers, monitoring contract performance, and making changes as needed

## Types of Contracts

### Fixed Price Contracts
1. **Firm fixed price (FFP)**: pay one amount regardless of how much it costs the contractor to do the work
2. **Fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF)**: pay a fixed price for the contract and give a bonus based on some performance goal
3. **Fixed price with economic cost adjustment (FPECA)**: a fixed price contract with special provisions to deal with very long-term adjustment

### Time and Material Contracts
- **Time and material contracts**: pay a rate for each of the people working on your project plus their material costs
  - *E.g., a fee of $80 per hr. for services plus a fixed price of $10,000 for providing specific project materials*

### Cost-reimbursable Contracts
1. **Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)**: pay the seller back for the costs involved in doing the work, plus an amount that you will pay on top of that
2. **Cost plus award fee (CPAF)**: similar to CPFF, except that instead of paying a fee on top of the cost, you agree to pay a fee based on the buyer's evaluation of the seller's performance
3. **Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)**: similar to CPAF but you pay a fee if some performance goals are met in the deliverable

### Cost Reimbursable Contracts Examples
- **Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)**:
  - *E.g., Kate agrees to set up her project using this contract type by suggesting that the team will get a $50,000 bonus if they keep the average wait time for the calls down to seven minutes per customer for over a month.*
- **Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)**:
  - *E.g., expected cost of a project is $100,000 and the fixed fee is $10,000. If the actual cost of the contract rises to $120,000, the contractor will still receive the fee of $10,000*

### Direct Vs Indirect Cost
- **Direct cost**
  - They are directly related to producing a project's products and services
  - They can be traced back to a project in a cost-effectively way
  - *E.g., The salary of the people working directly on a project and hardware or software purchased for a specific project*
- **Indirect cost**
  - They are not directly related to the products or services of the project
  - They cannot be traced back to a project in a cost-effectively way
  - *E.g., The cost of providing a workspace with electricity*

### Point of Total Assumption
- The **Point of Total Assumption (PTA)** is the cost at which the contractor assumes total responsibility for each additional dollar of contract cost
- Contractors do not want to reach the point of total assumption, because it hurts them financially, so they have an incentive to prevent cost overruns
- **Contract Clauses**
  - A **termination clause** is a contract clause that allows the buyer or supplier to end the contract

## Tools and Techniques for Planning Purchases and Acquisitions

1. **Expert judgment**
   - Technical, business and legal experts
2. **Market research**
   - Many suppliers are available. How to choose
3. **Make-or-buy analysis**:
   - General management techniques used to determine whether an organization should make or perform a particular product or service inside the organization or buy from someone else

### Make-or-Buy Example
- Assume you can lease an item you need for a project for $800/day. To purchase the item, the cost is $12,000 plus a daily operational cost of $400/day
- How long will it take for the purchase cost to be the same as the lease cost?

### Make-or Buy Solution
1. Set up an equation so both options, purchase and lease, are equal
2. In this example, use the following equation. Let *d* be the number of days to use the item:
   ```
   $12,000 + $400d = $800d
   ```
3. Subtracting $400d from both sides, you get:
   ```
   $12,000 = $400d
   ```
4. Dividing both sides by $400, you get:
   ```
   d = 30
   ```
- **If you need the item for more than 30 days, it is more economical to purchase it**

## Plan Procurement Management (1)

- Identifying which project needs can best be met by using products or services outside the organization
- If there is no need to buy any products or services from outside the organization, then there is no need to perform any of the other procurement management processes

### Procurement Management Plan
- Describes how the procurement processes will be managed, from developing documentation for making outside purchases or acquisitions to contract closure
- Contents varies based on project needs
- **Contents may include**:
  - Standard procurement documents and templates
  - Guidelines for creating contract, statement of works (SoW)
  - Roles and responsibilities of the project team and related departments, e.g., purchasing and legal departments
  - Guidelines for identifying pre-qualified sellers and preferred sellers
  - Procurement metrics to assist in evaluating sellers and managing contract
  - ...

## Conducting Procurements (2)

1. **Deciding whom to ask** to do the work
2. **Sending appropriate documentation** to potential sellers
3. **Obtaining proposals or bids**
4. **Selecting a seller**
5. **Awarding a contract**

### Contract Statement of Work (SOW)
- A **statement of work (SOW)** is a description of the work required for the procurement
- If a SOW is used as part of a contract to describe only the work required for that particular contract, it is called a **contract statement of work**
- A SOW is a type of scope statement (things to do)
- A good SOW gives bidders (potential suppliers) a better understanding of the buyer's expectations
  - Describes all services required and include performance reporting
  - Use **MUST** instead of MAY
  - Also specify the location of the work, the expected period of performance, specific deliverables and when they are due, acceptance criteria, etc.

### Statement of Work (SOW) Template
*(Sample SOW template)*

### Procurement Documents
- **Request for Proposals**: Used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers
  - A **proposal** is a document prepared by a seller when there are different approaches for meeting buyer needs
  - Problems → proposal of solutions
- **Requests for Quotes**: Used to solicit quotes or bids from prospective suppliers
  - A **bid**, also called a tender or quote (short for quotation), is a document prepared by sellers providing pricing for standard items that have been clearly defined by the buyer

### Request for Proposal (RFP) Template
*(Sample RFP template)*

### Source Selection Criteria
- It's important to prepare some form of evaluation criteria, preferably before issuing a formal RFP or RFQ
- Often assign a **weight** to each criterion to indicate its importance
- Beware of proposals that look good on paper; be sure to evaluate factors, such as past performance and management approach
- Can require a technical presentation as part of a proposal

### Approaches for Procurement
- Organizations can advertise to procure goods and services in several ways:
  1. Approaching the **preferred vendor**
  2. Approaching **several potential vendors**
  3. Advertising to **anyone interested**
- A **bidders' conference** can help clarify the buyer's expectations

### Sample Proposal Evaluation Sheet
*(Sample evaluation form with weighted criteria)*

### Seller Selection
- Organizations often do an initial evaluation of all proposals and bids and then develop a **short list** of potential sellers for further evaluation
- Sellers on the short list often prepare a **best and final offer (BAFO)**
- Final output is a **contract** signed by the buyer and the selected seller

## Controlling Procurements (3)

- Ensures that the seller's performance meets contractual requirements
- Contracts are legal relationships, so it is important that legal and contracting professionals be involved in writing and administering contracts

### Suggestions for Change Control in Contracts
1. **Changes to any part of the project** need to be reviewed, approved, and documented by the same people in the same way that the original part of the plan was approved
2. **Evaluation of any change** should include an impact analysis. How will the change affect the scope, time, cost, and quality of the goods or services being provided?
3. **Changes must be documented in writing**. Project team members should also document all important meetings and telephone phone calls
4. **Project managers and teams should stay closely involved** to make sure the new system will meet business needs and work in an operational environment
5. **Have backup plans**
6. **Use tools and techniques**, such as a contract change control system, buyer-conducted performance reviews, inspections and audits, and so on
