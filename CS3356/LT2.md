# Project Integration Management

## Project Integration Management Processes

1. **Develop the project charter (Initiation)**
   - Working with stakeholders to create the document that formally authorizes a project - the charter (what to be done)
2. **Develop the project management plan (Planning)**
   - A plan for how to manage a project
   - Coordinating all planning efforts (e.g., plan for time management and plan for scope management) to create a consistent, coherent document - the project management plan (how to do it)
3. **Direct and manage project execution (Execution)**
   - Carrying out the project management plan by performing the activities included in it

4. **Manage Project Knowledge (Execution)**
   - Building on the knowledge your team already has about the project and using it to solve problems as they come up.
5. **Monitor and control the project work (C & M)**
   - Overseeing project work to meet the performance objectives of the project
6. **Perform integrated change control (C & M)**
   - Coordinating changes that affect the project’s deliverables and organizational process assets
7. **Close the project (Closing)**
   - Finalizing all project activities to formally close the project

Before a project, someone needs to prepare a project proposal

## Strategic Planning and Project Selection

- How to propose/determine a project? (Why/what to do?)
- Strategic planning involves determining long-term objectives, predicting future trends, and projecting the need for new products and services
- Organizations often perform a SWOT analysis
  - Analyzing Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats
  - S & W : Internal factors; O & T: External factors
  - Then, find solutions to resolve your weaknesses
  - Compare the opportunities with threats (tradeoffs)

## Information Technology Planning Process

### Best Practice

- Companies most admired for their ability to apply IT-related business capabilities for competitive advantage
- Best practices of these companies include:
  - Customer-driven IT is essential
  - IT can enable branding and customer recruitment
  - Keep improving (monitoring and performance measures)
  - AI in banking industry and retail sales

## Methods for Selecting Projects

- As part of strategic planning, organizations
  - Identify potential projects
  - Use realistic methods (measurable and comparable) to select which projects to work on
  - Finalized project initiation by issuing a project charter
- There are usually more projects than available time and resources to implement them
  - Set priorities. Depending on what you want to get or maximize? Strategic goals (which one is the most important!)
- Methods for selecting projects include:
  1. Focusing on broad organizational needs
  2. Categorizing information technology projects
  3. Performing net present value (NPV) or other financial analyses
  4. Using a weighted scoring model

## 1. Focusing on Broad Organizational Needs

- It is often difficult to provide strong justification for many IT projects, but most people agree they have a high value
  - What are the impacts of IT to business/organization? To the staff and customers?
  - What are the benefits of using IT in business operations? Lower cost, smooth operations, higher efficiency, better image
- Some “old-style managed” business organizations are STILL quite reluctant in spending money on IT projects especially when the business is not good. Why? IT projects money spending
- Three important criteria for projects:
  - There is a need for the project
  - There are funds available
  - There’s a strong will to make the project succeed (E.g., green computing and automation)

## 2. Categorizing IT Projects

- One categorization is whether the project addresses:
  - A problem: undesirable situations that prevent an organization from achieving its goals
  - An opportunity: chances to improve the organization
  - A directive: new requirements by management, government or some external influence
- Another categorization is how long it will take to do and when it is needed (i.e., short, long and medium)
- All factors: the overall priority of the project (combining various factors to have weighted scores)

## 3. Financial Analysis of Projects

- Financial considerations (cost Vs. benefit) are often one of the most important considerations in selecting projects
- Methods for determining the projected financial value of projects (future returns)
  - Benefit and cost ratio (BCO)
  - Net present value (NPV) analysis
  - Return on investment (ROI)
  - Payback analysis (PA)

## 3. Payback Analysis

- The payback period: the amount of time it will take to recoup the total dollars invested in a project
- Payback occurs when the net cumulative discounted benefits equals the costs
- Many organizations want IT projects to have a fairly short payback period
- What will be the problem of a long payback period?
  - Affect cash flow
  - Uncertainty
- You may use a quarter or a month as the time unit

## 4. Weighted Scoring Model

A weighted scoring model:
1. Identify criteria important to the project selection process
2. Assign weights (percentages) to each criterion so they add up to 100%
3. Assign scores to each criterion for each project
4. Multiply the scores by the weights and get the total weighted scores
   - Showing the overall benefit
   - The higher the weighted score, the better

## Develop Project Charters (1)

- After deciding which project to work on, it is important to let the rest of the organization know
- A project charter:
  - A document that formally recognizes the existence of a project
  - It summarizes the business needs, current understanding of the customer needs, and the intended results of the project
  - A partnership between performing and requesting organizations
- Key project stakeholders should sign a project charter to acknowledge agreement on the need and intent of the project
- A signed charter is a key output of project integration management

### Project Charter Components:
- **Project statement of work**
  - Project objective, expected outcomes of the projects, needs, product description, etc.
- **Enterprise environment factors**
  - Industrial standard, structure and practice of organization, current resources, market situations, etc.
- **Organizational process asset**
  - Standard procedures of an organization, templates and historical information and lessons learn knowledge base
- **Business case**
  - The business benefits, market demands, organization needs, customer requests, legal requirement

## Organizational Process Assets

- **Process**: The way your organization does its work
- **Policies**: The rules your organization follows when it works
- **Procedures**: The practical guides that describe the steps each team will follow when they do work. These include: templates, supplier lists, change control guidance, financial control guidance, estimation method
- **Knowledge repositories**: The records of past projects that the organization has done. Here, you will find all the lessons learned from past teams

## Project Management Plans (2)

- A plan for carrying out a project
- A project management plan is a document used to coordinate all project planning documents (e.g., time, scope, risk, ...) and help guide a project’s execution and control
- Plans created in the other knowledge areas (e.g., time and cost) are subsidiary parts of the overall project management plan
- How to develop? With inputs from all the stakeholders including the development team members. Why?
- Contents of a project management plan depends on the nature of the project itself as well as the organization
  - Simple: Project charter + scope statement + Gantt chart
  - Usually, a big document!


### Common Elements of a Project Management Plan

- Introduction or overview of the project
- Description of how the project is organized
- Management and technical processes used on the project
- Work to be done, schedule, and budget information
- Based on the project charter, add more details, and more concrete ...

## Directing and Managing Project Work (3)

- Project execution involves managing and performing the work described in the project management plan
  - Perform management works and the project works
- The majority of time and money is usually spent on execution
- Project planning and execution are intertwined and inseparable activities (Planning -> Execution ↔ C&M)
- Those who will do the work should help to plan the work
- Project managers must solicit input from the team to develop realistic plans. What is a realistic plan? More details, practical and expert judgement
- Conflict between team members and the PM!

## Providing Leadership and a Supportive Culture

- Direct the project, require leadership and understand the culture
- **Leadership**
  - How to be a good leader? Give the direction
  - Project managers must lead by example to demonstrate the importance of creating and then following good project plans
  - Conflict between team members and PM (listening and discussion)
- **Organizational culture and line of authority**
  - Providing guidelines and templates
  - Tracking performance based on plans
  - Project managers may still need to break the rules to meet project goals, and senior managers must support those actions
    - Do the right thing at the right time. WHAT???
    - How to persuade them to support?
    - Conflict between PM and senior management (explaining)

## Senior Management vs. Project Manager vs. Team Members

**Senior Management**
- Quicker, better quality, higher efficiency

**Project Manager**
- More resource, better benefits, more time

**Team Members**
- Pressure
- Complaint
- I DON'T WANT TO CREATE TROUBLE! JUST WANT TO COMPLETE MY JOB!

## Important Skills for Project Execution

- General management skills like leadership, communication, and political skills
  - political skills: Dealing with people, negotiation, resolving conflicts, ...
  - Key of management skill
  - Clearly defined responsibility and authority
- Product, business, and application area skills and knowledge (technical)
  - How does the industry operate?
- Use of specialized tools and techniques
  - Development and project management

## Project Execution Tools & Techniques

- **Project management methodology**
  - most effective way to improve project management is to follow a good methodology: what to do in managing a project + how to do it
- **Meetings**
  - develop relationships
  - pick up on important body language or tone of voice
  - have a dialogue to help resolve problems
- **Project management information systems**
  - There are hundreds of project management software products available on the market today, and many organizations are moving toward powerful enterprise project management systems
- **Expert judgment**
  - Seek for expert advice if necessary
  - Good connection with GOOD people (good network)

## Manage Project Knowledge (4)

- It is about using the information your company has already learn from doing past projects
- creating new information when your team learns something your company has not encountered before
- PM, your whole team, entire organization and even people outside of it, can have learnt some important information.
- LEARN FROM OUR FAILOURS! WHY? AVOID REPEATED MISTAKES!
- Some of the knowledge is explicit, or written down in documents and files.
- Some is tacit in people's head or embedded in the company's culture
- It includes building a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing
- **Output**: lesson learned register, organizational process assets updates, project management plan updates

## Monitoring and Controlling Project Work (5)

- Changes are inevitable on most projects -> to develop and follow a process to monitor and control changes
  - A plan helps us to start but cannot help us to finish
  - Change is inevitable but unmanaged changes could kill a project
- HOW? Collecting (reports), measuring (performance figures), and disseminating performance information
- Two important outputs of monitoring and controlling project work include recommended corrective and preventive actions
- Performance reports provide information on how project execution is going
  - Performance Report => Problem? => Corrective/preventive actions needed?
- **Output**: change request

## Performing Integrated Change Control (6)

Three main objectives are:
1. Influencing the factors that create changes to ensure that changes are beneficial
   - Tradeoffs amongst the key project dimensions, time, cost and scope
2. Determining that a change has occurred
   - Review performance report and project status
3. Managing actual changes as they occur
   - A baseline is the approved project management plan + approved changes
   - Different types of baseline: time baseline and cost baseline for different performance goals

## Change Control on Information Technology Projects

- **Former view**: the project team should strive to do exactly what was planned on time and within budget
  - Problem: stakeholders rarely agreed up-front on the project scope, and time and cost estimates were inaccurate
- **Modern view**: project management is a process of constant communication and negotiation
  - Solution: changes are often beneficial (and unavoidable), and the project team should plan for them

## Change Control System

- A formal documented process that describes when and how official project documents and work may be changed
  - Controlled changes are highly important
  - Changes have to be done carefully
  - Similar to amending a program especially when a team of people working on the same application
- Describes who is authorized to make changes
  - He knows what changes have been made

## Change Control Board (CCB)

- A formal group of people responsible for approving or rejecting changes on a project (authority)
- CCBs provide guidelines for preparing change requests, evaluate change requests, and manage the implementation of approved changes
- Includes the main stakeholders from the organization
- A formal group for control change is good for making changes carefully. However ...

## Making Timely Changes

- Some CCBs only meet occasionally, so it may take too long for changes to occur
  - CCBs are good for controlling changes but may not be efficient and flexible to handle change requests
- Some organizations have policies in place for time-sensitive changes
  - “48-hour policy” allows project team members to make decisions, then they have 48 hours to reverse the decision pending senior management approval
  - Delegate changes to the lowest level possible, but keep everyone informed of changes
  
## Suggestions for Performing Integrated Change Control

- View project management as a process of constant communication and negotiation.
- Plan for change.
- Establish a formal change control system, including a change control board (CCB).
- Use effective configuration management.
- Define procedures for making timely decisions on smaller changes.
- Use written and oral performance reports to help identify and manage change.
- Use project management and other software to help manage and communicate changes.
- Focus on leading the project team and meeting overall project goals and expectations.

## Closing Projects (7)

- To close a project, you must finalize all activities and transfer the completed or cancelled work to the appropriate people
- Main outputs include:
  - Administrative closure procedures
  - Contract closure procedures
  - Final products, services, or results
  - Organizational process asset updates (lessons learnt reports)
  - DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN!!!
