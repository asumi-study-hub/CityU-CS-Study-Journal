# Project Communications Management
## Managing Software Projects

## Importance of Good Communications

  - **Communication ≠ relation/network ≠ Speaking**
  - **Exchange of ideas (Give and get)**
  - I have problems in communications => listener/speaker and writer/reader
- Lack of communication channels and ineffective communications
- Our culture does not portray IT professionals as being good communicators
  - Mostly concentrated on technical issues, methodologies and algorithms

  - Senior IT professionals have to know how to manage people and
  - How to communications with senior and junior people
- Strong verbal skills are a key factor in career advancement for IT professionals
  - Communications with machines Vs. Communications with people

### Study on Importance of Non-technical Skills
- problem solving
- teamwork
- listening/presenting
- Some organizations will hire individuals with minimal technical skills so long as they demonstrate solid soft and business skills

## Project Communications Management Processes

1. **Planning communications management**: Determining the information and communications needs of the stakeholders
2. **Managing communications**: Creating, distributing, storing, retrieving, and disposing of project communications based on the communications management plan
3. **Controlling communications**: Monitoring and controlling project communications to ensure that stakeholder communication needs are met

## Keys to Good Communications

- Project managers say they spend as much as 90 percent of their time communicating
- Need to focus on group and individual communication needs
- Use formal and informal methods for communication (formal/informal written and verbal)
- Distribute important information (e.g., reports) in an effective and timely manner (periodic or instance)
- Set the stage for communicating bad news (no big surprise)
- Determine the number of communication channels

## Understanding Group and Individual Communication Needs

- People are not interchangeable parts
- a task originally scheduled to take two months of one person's time can be done in one month by two people
  - Nine women cannot produce a baby in one month!
- Different people should be communicated in different ways

### Personal Preferences Affect Communication Needs
- **Introverts** like more private communications, while **extroverts** like to discuss things in public
- **Intuitive people** like to understand the big picture, while **sensing people** need step-by-step details
- **Thinkers** want to know the logic behind decisions, while **feeling people** want to know how something affects them personally
- **Judging people** are driven to meet deadlines while **perceiving people** need more help in developing and following plans

### Importance of Face-to-Face Communication
- Research says that in a face-to-face interaction:
  - **58 percent** of communication is through body language
  - **35 percent** of communication is through how the words are said
  - **7 percent** of communication is through the content or words that are spoken
- Pay attention to more than just the actual words someone is saying (eye contact)
- A person's tone of voice and body language say a lot about how he or she really feels

### Setting the Stage for Communicating Bad News


### Encouraging More Face-to-Face Interactions
- Short, frequent meetings (messages) -> effective
- Stand-up meetings -> force people to focus on what they really need to communicate
- Some companies have policies -> preventing the use of e-mail/whatsapp between certain hours or even entire days of the week

### Distributing Information in an Effective and Timely Manner
- Don't bury crucial information
- Don't be afraid to report bad information
- Oral communication via meetings and informal talks helps bring important information—good and bad—out into the open (leaking of information may be good sometimes)

### Other Communication Considerations
- Rarely does the receiver interpret a message exactly as the sender intended (10 people -> 10 different interpretations)
- Geographic location and cultural background affect the complexity of project communications
  - Different working hours
  - Language barriers
  - Different cultural norms

### Determining the Number of Communications Channels
- As the number of people involved increases, the complexity of communications increases because there are more communications channels or pathways through which people can communicate.
- **Number of communications channels = n(n - 1) ÷ 2**
  where *n* is the number of people involved

### The Impact of the Number of People on Communications Channels

## Planning Communications Management (1)

- Every project should include some type of communications management plan, a document that guides project communications
- The communications management plan varies with the needs of the project, but some type of written plan should always be prepared
- For small projects, the communications management plan can be part of the team contract
- For large projects, it should be a separate document

### Communications Management Plan Contents
1. Stakeholder communications requirements
2. Information to be communicated, including format, content, and level of detail
3. Who will receive the information and who will produce it
4. Suggested methods or technologies for conveying the information
5. Frequency of communication (formal)
6. Escalation procedures for resolving issues
7. Revision procedures for updating the communications management plan
8. A glossary of common terminology

### Sample Stakeholder Analysis for Project Communications
*(Table showing stakeholder communication preferences)*

## Managing Communications (2)

- Managing communications is a large part of a project manager's job
- Getting project information to the right people at the right time and in a useful format is just as important as developing the information in the first place
- Important considerations include the use of technology, the appropriate methods and media to use, and performance reporting

### Classifications for Communication Methods
1. **Interactive communication**: Two or more people interact to exchange information via meetings, phone calls, or video conferencing. Most effective way to ensure common understanding
2. **Push communication**: Information is sent or pushed to recipients without their request via reports, e-mails, instance messages, voice mails, and other means. Ensures that the information is distributed, but does not ensure that it was received or understood
3. **Pull communication**: Information is sent to recipients at their request via Web sites, bulletin boards, e-learning, knowledge repositories like blogs, and other means

### Media Choice Table
*(Table comparing communication media effectiveness)*

### Reporting Performance
- Performance reporting keeps stakeholders informed about how resources are being used to achieve project objectives
- **Status reports** describe where the project stands at a specific point in time (current status)
- **Progress reports** describe what the project team has accomplished during a certain period of time (what have been done)
- **Forecasts** predict future project status and progress based on past information and trends (what will be done)

## Controlling Communications (3)

- The main goal of controlling communications is to ensure the optimal flow of information throughout the entire project life cycle
- The project manager and project team should use their various reporting systems, expert judgment, and meetings to assess how well communications are working.
- If problems exist, the project manager and team need to take action, which often requires changes to the earlier processes of planning and managing project communications
- It is often beneficial to have a facilitator from outside the project team assess how well communications are working

## Suggestions for Improving Project Communications

1. **Develop better communication skills**
2. **Run effective meetings**
3. **Use e-mail, whatsapp and other technologies effectively**
4. **Use templates for project communications**

### Developing Better Communication Skills
- Most companies spend a lot of money on technical training for their employees, even when employees might benefit more from communications training
- Individual employees are also more likely to enroll voluntarily in classes to learn the latest technology than in classes that develop soft skills
- As organizations become more global, they realize they must invest in ways to improve communication with people from different countries and cultures

### Media Snapshot
- social media blunders that cost a job or something worse, including:
  - Posting something embarrassing on the corporate Twitter feed
  - Sexual oversharing
  - Revealing company secrets
  - Making fun of your boss/team
  - Posting while you're supposed to be working

### Running Effective Meetings
1. Define the purpose and intended outcome of the meeting
2. Determine who should attend the meeting
3. Provide an agenda to participants before the meeting
4. Prepare handouts and visual aids, and make logistical arrangements ahead of time
5. Run the meeting professionally
6. Set the ground rules for the meeting
7. Build relationships (formal and informal)

### Using E-Mail, Instant Messaging, Texting, and Collaborative Tools Effectively
- Make sure that e-mail, instant messaging, texting, or collaborative tools are an appropriate medium for what you want to communicate
- Be sure to send information to the right people
- Use meaningful subject lines and limit the content of emails to one main subject, and be as clear and concise as possible
- Be sure to authorize the right people to share and edit your collaborative documents

### Using Templates for Project Communications
- Many technical people are afraid to ask for help
- Providing examples and templates for project communications saves time and money
- Organizations can develop their own templates, use some provided by outside organizations, or use samples from textbooks
- Recall that research shows that companies that excel in project management make effective use of templates

### Sample Template for a Monthly Progress Report
*(Sample report template)*

### Final Project Documentation Items
*(List of required project documentation)*

### Lessons Learned Reports
- The project manager and project team members should each prepare a lessons-learned report
- A reflective statement that documents important things an individual learned from working on the project
- The project manager often combines information from all of the lessons-learned reports into a project summary report

### Project Archives
- It is also important to organize and prepare project archives
- Project archives are a complete set of organized project records that provide an accurate history of the project
- These archives can provide valuable information for future projects as well

### Project Web Sites
- Many project teams create a project Web site to store important product documents and other information
- Can create the site using various types of software, such as enterprise project management software
- Several project management tools can be used on multiple devices

### Using Software to Assist in Project Communications
- There are many software tools to aid in project communications
- Today many people telecommute or work remotely
- Project management software includes new capabilities to enhance virtual communications
- While technology can aid in the communications process, it is not the most important. Far more important is improving an organization's ability to communicate, which often involves cultural change
- Work from home and mobile offices
