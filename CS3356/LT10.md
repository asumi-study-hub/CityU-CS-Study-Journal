# Project Resource Management
## Managing Software Projects

## Introduction to Resource Management

- You have a list of activities from scope management. How can you complete them?
- We need different resources at different stages of a project
  - **Firstly**, you need to have your team members at the beginning
    - How to get the team members, e.g., from other departments? Recruit from outside?
    - Political issues, depending on the organization of your project
    - Right people at the right time (good people needs to be competed with other teams and departments)
  - **Secondly**, other people including testers, data input, and technical writers may be required at the latter stage of a project
- Resources also include software, hardware and other devices. They may be needed to be purchased through the procurement dept (take time)

## Importance of Human Resources

- Many corporate executives have SAID, "People are our most important asset"
- People determine the success and failure of organizations and projects
- Although there have been ups and downs in the IT labor market, there will always be a need for GOOD IT workers

### Workforce Management Strategies
- Proactive organizations are addressing workforce needs by:
  - Improving benefits
  - Redefining work hours and incentives
  - Finding future workers
  - The benefits on working in Google

### Work-Life Balance Issues
- Here's the dirty little secret: U.S. productivity is No. 1 in the world when productivity is measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per worker, but our lead vanishes when productivity is measured as GDP per hour worked...Europeans take an average of six to seven weeks of paid annual leave, compared with just 12 days in the United States; twice as many American as European workers put in more than 48 hours per week
- Sociologists have shown that many Americans, especially men, would like to have more family or leisure time; recent surveys show that many Americans are willing to sacrifice up to a quarter of their salaries in return for more time off => work life balance

### Skills Gap in Workforce
- A report by The Conference Board, Corporate Voices for Working Families, Partnership for 21st Century Skills, and the Society for Human Resource Management suggests that entry level workers in the U.S. are ill-prepared for the workplace
- **Four-year college graduates were listed as deficient in the following three skills**:
  - Written communications - 27.8%
  - Writing in English - 26.2%
  - Leadership - 23.8%

### What Went Wrong?
- A report by CompTIA found a gap between skills that employers wanted and what they actually found in the IT workforce
  - 68 percent of IT firms report having a very challenging time finding new staff
  - 58 percent of businesses are concerned about the quality and quantity of IT talent available for hire
  - The number one strategy to handle understaffing is requiring workers to put in more hours

## Project Resource Management Processes

1. **Planning resource management**: identifying and documenting project roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships
2. **Estimating activity resources**
3. **Acquiring resources**: getting the needed personnel assigned to and working on the project
4. **Developing the team**: building individual and group skills to enhance project performance
5. **Managing the team**: tracking team member performance, motivating team members, providing timely feedback, resolving issues and conflicts, and coordinating changes to help enhance project performance
6. **Control resources**

## Theoretical Foundations

### Motivation Theories
- Psychologists and management theorists have devoted much research and thought to the field of managing people at work
- Important areas related to project management include:
  - Motivation theories
  - Influence and power
  - Emotional intelligence
  - Leadership

### Types of Motivation
- **Intrinsic motivation** causes people to participate in an activity for their own enjoyment
- **Extrinsic motivation** causes people to do something for a reward or to avoid a penalty
  - For example, some children take piano lessons for intrinsic motivation (they enjoy it) while others take them for extrinsic motivation (to get a reward or avoid punishment)

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
- Abraham Maslow argued that humans possess unique qualities that enable them to make independent choices, thus giving them control of their destiny
- Maslow developed a **hierarchy of needs** which states that people's behaviors are guided or motivated by a sequence of needs
  *(Pyramid showing: Physiological → Safety → Social → Esteem → Self-actualization)*

### Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory
- Frederick Herzberg distinguished between:
  - **Motivational factors**: achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth, which produce job satisfaction
  - **Hygiene factors**: cause dissatisfaction if not present, but do not motivate workers to do more; examples include larger salaries (fixed), more supervision, and a more attractive work environment

*(Diagram showing Motivators vs. Hygiene factors)*

### McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y
- Douglas McGregor popularized the human relations approach to management in the 1960s
  - **Theory X**: assumes workers dislike and avoid work, so managers must use coercion, threats, and various control schemes to get workers to meet objectives
  - **Theory Y**: assumes individuals consider work as natural as play or rest and enjoy the satisfaction of esteem and self-actualization needs
  - **Theory Z**: introduced in 1981 by William Ouchi and is based on the Japanese approach to motivating workers, emphasizing trust, quality, collective decision making, and cultural values

### Ways to Have Influence on Projects
1. **Authority**: the legitimate hierarchical right to issue orders
2. **Assignment**: the project manager's perceived ability to influence a worker's later work assignments
3. **Budget**: the project manager's perceived ability to authorize others' use of discretionary funds
4. **Promotion**: the ability to improve a worker's position
5. **Money**: the ability to increase a worker's pay and benefits
6. **Penalty**: the project manager's ability to cause punishment
7. **Work challenge**: the ability to assign work that capitalizes on a worker's enjoyment of doing a particular task
8. **Expertise**: the project manager's perceived special knowledge that others deem important
9. **Friendship**: the ability to establish friendly personal relationships between the project manager and others

### Types of Power
- **Legitimate power**: By position. When you are someone's boss, you have legitimate power
- **Reward power**: you can award a bonus or another kind of reward in order to motivate team members
- **Expert power**: the team respects you for your expertise in a specific area, and give you credibility because of that
- **Referent power**: people admire you, are loyal to you and want to do what you do because you are trusted by people in authority, and others perceived you as associated with success. E.g., If you buy something because a celebrity does, that's referent power.

### Effective Influence Strategies
- Projects are more likely to succeed when project managers influence with:
  - Expertise
  - Work challenge
- Projects are more likely to fail when project managers rely too heavily on:
  - Authority
  - Money
  - Penalty

### Covey's 7 Habits for Project Managers
- Project managers can apply Covey's 7 habits to improve effectiveness on projects
  1. **Be proactive**
  2. **Begin with the end in mind**
  3. **Put first things first**
  4. **Think win/win**
  5. **Seek first to understand, then to be understood**
  6. **Synergize** (1 + 1 > 2)
  7. **Sharpen the saw** (Balance and renew your resources, energy, and health to create a sustainable, long-term, effective lifestyle)

### Empathic Listening
- Good project managers are empathic listeners; they listen with the intent to understand
- Before you can communicate with others, you have to have **rapport**, a relation of harmony, conformity, accord, or affinity
- **Mirroring** is the matching of certain behaviors of the other person, a technique to help establish rapport
- IT professionals need to develop empathic listening and other people skills to improve relationships with users and other stakeholders

### Emotional Intelligence
- The Theory of Multiple Intelligences introduced the concept of using more than one way to think of and measure human intelligence
- **Emotional intelligence (EI)** is knowing and managing one's own emotions and understanding the emotions of others for improved performance
- 71 percent of U.S. hiring managers say they value EI more than IQ

### Leadership Styles
- There is no one best way to be a leader
- Most experts agree that the best leaders are able to adapt their style to needs of the situation
- Daniel Goleman, author of *Emotional Intelligence* and *Primal Leadership*, describes six leadership styles:
  1. **Visionary**
  2. **Coaching**
  3. **Affiliative**
  4. **Democratic**
  5. **Pacesetting**
  6. **Commanding**

## Planning Resource Management

- Involves how to identify and document project resources requirements including the roles and responsibility of the stakeholders
- **Contents include**:
  - Project organizational charts
  - Staffing management plan
  - Responsibility assignment matrixes
  - Resource histograms

### Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)
- A **responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)** is a matrix that maps the work of the project as described in the WBS to the people responsible for performing the work

### Sample RACI Chart
*(Matrix showing tasks vs. team members with RACI codes)*
- **R** = responsibility
- **A** = accountability, only one A per task
- **C** = consultation
- **I** = informed
*Note that some people reverse the definitions of responsible and accountable.*

### Staffing Management Plan and Resource Histogram
- A **staffing management plan** describes when and how people will be added to and taken off the project team
- A **resource histogram** is a column chart that shows the number of resources assigned to a project over time

*(Sample histogram chart)*

## Estimating Activity Resources

- Estimate activity resources is to estimate the resources needed for each activity in the activity list.
- **Resource calendar**: Before you can assign resources to your project, you need to know which ones you are authorized to use on your project and at which time
- **Tools**:
  - Expert judgement
  - Analogous estimation
  - Parametric estimation
  - Bottom-up estimation
- **Outputs**:
  - Basis of estimates (how to estimate)
  - Resource requirements
  - Resource breakdown structure

### Resource Loading and Leveling
- **Resource loading** refers to the amount of individual resources an existing schedule requires during specific time periods
  - Helps project managers develop a general understanding of the demands a project will make on the organization's resources and individual people's schedules
- **Over allocation** means that more resources than are available are assigned to perform work at a given time

*(Chart showing resource loading)*

- **Resource leveling** is a technique for resolving resource conflicts by delaying tasks
  - The main purpose of resource leveling is to create a smoother distribution of resource usage and reduce over allocation

*(Chart showing resource leveling)*

### Benefits of Resource Leveling
1. When resources are used on a more constant basis, they require less management
2. It results in fewer problems for project personnel and accounting department
3. It often improves morale

## Acquiring Resources

- Acquiring qualified people for teams is crucial
- The project manager who is the smartest person on the team has done a poor job of recruiting!
- It is important to assign the appropriate type and number of people to work on projects at the appropriate times
- Physical resource assignments are all about making sure your team has the equipment they need to do the work
- **Halo effect**: when you put someone in a position they can't handle, just because they're good at another job

### Recruitment and Retention Strategies
- Staffing plans and good hiring procedures are important, as are incentives for recruiting and retention
  - Some companies give their employees one dollar for every hour a new person they helped hire works
  - Some organizations allow people to work from home as an incentive
- CIO's researchers suggest that organizations rethink hiring practices and incentives to hire and retain IT talent

## Developing the Team

- The main goal of team development is to help people work together more effectively to improve project performance
- It takes teamwork to successfully complete most projects

### Training and Coaching
- **Training**: give you some new knowledge/skill
- **Coaching**: help you to develop to acquire new knowledge/skill
- Training/coaching can help people understand themselves, each other, and how to work better in teams
- **Team building activities include**:
  - Physical challenges
  - Psychological preference indicator tools

### Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
- MBTI is a popular tool for determining personality preferences and helping teammates understand each other
- 16 distinctive personality types that result from the interactions among the preferences
- **Four dimensions include**:
  1. **Extrovert/Introvert (E/I)**
  2. **Sensation/Intuition (S/N)**
  3. **Thinking/Feeling (T/F)**
  4. **Judgment/Perception (J/P)**

### MBTI Characteristics
- **Introverts** like more private communications, while **extroverts** like to discuss things in public
- **Intuitive people** like to understand the big picture, while **sensing people** need step-by-step details
- **Thinkers** want to know the logic behind decisions, while **feeling people** want to know how something affects them personally
- **Judging people** are driven to meet deadlines while **perceiving people** need more help in developing and following plans

### IT Professionals and MBTI
- NTs or rationals are attracted to technology fields
- IT people vary most from the general population in not being extroverted or sensing
- **MBTI Test**: https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality

### Reward and Recognition Systems
- Team-based reward and recognition systems can promote teamwork
  - Focus on rewarding teams for achieving specific goals
  - Allow time for team members to mentor and help each other to meet project goals and develop human resources
  - Promotion plan/Touch base

## Managing the Project Team (5)

- Project managers must lead their teams in performing various project activities
- After assessing team performance and related information, the project manager must decide:
  - if changes should be requested to the project
  - if corrective or preventive actions should be recommended
  - if updates are needed to the project management plan or organizational process assets.

### Tools and Techniques for Managing Project Teams
1. **Observation and conversation**
2. **Project performance appraisals**
   - KPI: key performance indicator
3. **Interpersonal skills/soft skill**
4. **Conflict management techniques**

### Stages of Team Development
1. **Forming**: People are still trying to figure out their roles in the group. They tend to work independently
2. **Storming**: As the team learns more about the project, members form opinions about how the work should be done leading to conflicts
3. **Norming**: As the team learns more about the other members, they begin to adjust their own work habits to help out one another and the team as a whole
4. **Performing**: Once everyone understands the problem and what the others are capable of doing, they start acting as a cohesive unit and being efficient
5. **Adjourning**: When the work is close to completion, the team starts dealing with the fact that the project is going to be closing soon.

### Conflict Handling Modes
1. **Confrontation**: Directly face a conflict using a problem-solving approach
2. **Compromise**: Use a give-and-take approach
3. **Smoothing**: De-emphasize areas of difference and emphasize areas of agreement
4. **Forcing**: The win-lose approach
5. **Withdrawal**: Retreat or withdraw from an actual or potential disagreement
6. **Collaborating**: Decision makers incorporate different viewpoints and insights to develop consensus and commitment

### Conflict Handling Modes Diagram
*(Visual representation of conflict handling styles)*

### Conflict Can Be Good
- Conflict often produces important results, such as new ideas, better alternatives, and motivation to work harder and more collaboratively
- **Groupthink**: Conformance to the values or ethical standards of a group. Groupthink can develop if there are no conflicting viewpoints
- Research suggests that task-related conflict often improves team performance, but emotional conflict often depresses team performance

### Best Practices for Team Management
1. Be patient and kind with your team
2. Fix the problem instead of blaming people
3. Establish regular, effective meetings
4. Allow time for teams to go through the basic team-building stages
5. Limit the size of work teams to three to seven members
6. Plan some social activities to help project team members and other stakeholders get to know each other better
7. Stress team identity
8. Nurture team members and encourage them to help each other
9. Take additional actions to work with virtual team members

### Five Dysfunctions of Teams
The five dysfunctions of teams are:
1. **Absence of trust**
2. **Fear of conflict**
3. **Lack of commitment**
4. **Avoidance of accountability**
5. **Inattention to results**

## Control Resources (6)

- Project doesn't always happen exactly as planned and that's why you need to make sure your resources are ready when they're needed and released to other teams when they're not needed.
- **Control resources** is all about comparing your actual project data to the plan and adapting as you go
- **Tools**:
  - **Data analysis** allows you to understand what is happening on your project.
  - **Problem solving** comes in when you run into issues that don't have a straightforward answer.
  - **Interpersonal and team skills** will be useful when you're negotiating with people to get more resources
  - **Project management information system** can help you to track the resources.
