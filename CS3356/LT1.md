The handouts in here are modified from *Information Technology Project Management, Ninth Edition, Copyright 2019*

## What is a Project?

- A **Project** is "a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result" (PMBOK® Guide, Sixth Edition)
- A Project can create:
  - A product that can be either a component of another or an end item in itself
  - A capability to perform a service
  - A result such as an outcome or document (i.e., a research project that develops knowledge that can be used to determine whether a trend is present or a new process will be benefit society)

### Characteristics of a Project
- A Project:
  - has a **unique purpose (objectives)** and is **temporary**
  - has a **start time** and an **end time**
  - Should have a **primary/target customer/user or sponsor**
    - The project sponsor usually provides the direction and funding for the project
  - Projects can be large or small and take a short or long time to complete
- **Operation Vs. project** (begin -> end)
  - **Operations** (daily operations) is work done to sustain the business

### Examples of Projects
**We have many PROJECTS!!!**
In school, life, work ....
Doing an assignment, building a PC, creating a new app, planning a trip, etc..
*Temporary endeavor*

## IT Projects

- The projects in IT industry
- IT projects are highly important in modern societies and business
  - Computer systems have radically changed our work and living
- More than 4.2 million people in US regard project management as their profession
- Worldwide IT spending was $5.2 trillion in 2024
- Its importance becomes greater and greater, ... Think about your daily lives and the society

### IT Project Examples
1. A team of students creates a smartphone app for selling online
2. A company develops a driverless car
3. A government group develops a system to track child immunizations
4. A global bank acquires other financial institutions and needs to consolidate systems and procedures
5. Your FYP

### Top Strategic IT Technologies for 2025
1. IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems
2. VR/AR
3. AI/ML
4. Data Science/Big Data
5. Cybersecurity
6. Blockchain/Fintech

## What is Project Management?

- **Project Vs. Project Management**
- **Project management**
  - "The application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements" (PMBOK® Guide, Sixth Edition)
- Managing a project typically involves **(NOT developing SW)**:
  1. Identifying requirements
  2. Addressing the various concerns, and expectations of the people involved (stakeholders) as the project is planned and carried out
  3. Balancing the project constraints: **scope, time, and cost** (Triple constraints)
     - Other than these, we still have other constraints
  4. **Scope ≠ requirements**

### The Triple Constraint
*(Triangle diagram showing Scope, Time, Cost constraints)*
- I.e., reducing time increases costs
- Increasing scope =>?
- Normally, when one of the constraints changes, at least one other constraint is likely to be affected
- **WHY?**

### Challenges in Project Management
**We have many FAILED PROJECTS!!!**
Project Management is difficult!!!
IT projects are MORE difficult to management, ... **WHY?**

- Project management is NOT easy (very DIFFICULT)
- IT Projects have a terrible track record
  - According to the PMI research, across all industries, the average percentage of projects that are deemed failures is 14 percent
- **Why do IT project fail?**
  - Poor communication is a common reason of project failure
  - IT: Changing technologies and lack of experiences ...
  - I have thirty years experiences in IT project management. Why you say I DO NOT have the experiences for the job?

### Famous Project Failures
1. **Healthcare.gov (2013)**
   - Overview: The launch of the U.S. federal health insurance marketplace was plagued by technical issues.
   - Failures: The website experienced significant downtime, slow load times, and bugs that prevented users from enrolling in health plans.
   - Impact: The failure highlighted the need for better project management and oversight in government IT projects, leading to a significant overhaul of the platform.

2. **NHS National Programme for IT (2002-2011)**
   - Overview: This ambitious project aimed to create a centralized electronic health record system for the UK's National Health Service.
   - Failures: The project faced numerous challenges, including technological incompatibility, lack of user engagement, and budget overruns.
   - Impact: After spending approximately £10 billion, the program was officially scrapped in 2011, serving as a cautionary tale for large-scale IT projects in healthcare.

3. **Boeing 737 MAX Software Issues (2018)**
   - Overview: The software used in the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft faced critical failures, leading to two fatal crashes.
   - Failures: Issues with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) went unaddressed, resulting in a global grounding of the aircraft.
   - Impact: The incidents led to a complete redesign of the software and significant financial losses for Boeing, along with a loss of public trust.

### How to Improve Project Success?
- **How to solve the problem?**
- Recent research findings show that companies that excel in project delivery (learn from the good people):
  1. **Use an integrated project management toolbox** (use standard/advanced PM tools, lots of templates)
  2. **Grow project leaders**, emphasizing business and soft skills (the skills for dealing with people)
  3. **Develop a streamlined project delivery process** following a methodology
  4. **Measure project health (monitoring)** using metrics, like customer satisfaction or return on investment

## Project Management Framework

### Ten Knowledge Areas
*(Visual showing 10 knowledge areas)*
1. **Integration**
2. **Scope**
3. **Time**
4. **Cost**
5. **Quality**
6. **Procurement**
7. **Resources**
8. **Communications**
9. **Risk management**
10. **Stakeholder management**

### Five Process Groups
- To manage a project, you need to complete a lot of tasks/job (processes) and they can be classified into different stages/phases in a project
  1. **Initiating**
  2. **Planning**
  3. **Executing**
  4. **Monitoring and Controlling**
  5. **Closing**

### Project Management Process Groups
*(Diagram showing 5 process groups)*

## Organizational Context

### Organizational Structures
- 3 basic organization structures:
  1. **Functional**: functional managers (e.g. sales, marketing, IT, HRM) report to the CEO
  2. **Project**: program managers report to the CEO
  3. **Matrix**: middle ground between functional and project structures; personnel often report to two or more bosses

### Organizational Culture
- Know your organization
- **Organizational culture** is a set of shared assumptions, values, and behaviors that characterize the functioning of an organization
  - Government organization Vs. NGO Vs. Private
  - European VS. US Vs. Chinese Vs. Japanese
- Many experts believe the underlying causes of many companies' problems are not the structure or staff, but the culture
  - How to change the organizational culture? Not easy! Must be from the top

### Some Characteristics of Organizational Culture
1. Member identity
2. Group emphasis
3. People focus
4. Authority and Liability
5. Risk tolerance
6. Reward criteria
7. Conflict tolerance
8. Business focus
*Most them are related to ...*

### Need for Organizational Commitment to IT
- What is IT? CS Vs. IT
- In the past, this is a big problem. Poor business, cut IT?
- Now, MORE commitment and fast growing
- If the organization has a negative attitude toward IT, it will be difficult for an IT project to success
- Having a **Chief Information Officer (CIO)** at a high level in the organization helps IT projects
- Assigning non-IT people to IT projects also encourage more commitment

## Stakeholder Management

- **Stakeholders** are the people involved in or affected by project activities
  - Note: People are very difficult to deal with
- Stakeholders include:
  - The project sponsor
  - The project manager
  - The project team
  - Support staff
  - Customers and users
  - Suppliers
  - Etc...

*(Visual showing different stakeholders)*

### Stakeholder Management Importance
- Project managers must take time to identify, understand, and manage relationships with all (important) project stakeholders
- Senior executives/top management are very important stakeholders
- A very important factor in helping project managers successfully lead projects is the level of commitment and support they receive from top management

### How Top Management Can Help Project Managers
1. Providing adequate resources
2. Approving unique project needs in a timely manner
3. Getting cooperation from other parts of the organization
4. Mentoring and coaching on leadership issues (long term)
5. Know your BOSS and GET HIS SUPPORT

## Project Standards and Life Cycle

### Need for Organizational Standards
- Standards and guidelines help project managers be more effective
  - How to do a specific task
- Senior management can encourage:
  - The use of standard forms and software tools for project management
  - The development and use of guidelines for writing project plans or providing status information
  - The creation of a **project management office (PMO)** (large organizations)

### Project Life Cycle
- A **project life cycle** is a collection of project phases that defines:
  - What work will be performed in each phase
  - What deliverables will be produced and when
  - Who is involved in each phase, and
  - How management will control and approve work produced in each phase
- A **deliverable** is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project (an output)

### More on Project Phases
- **In early phases** of a project life cycle:
  - Resource needs are usually lowest
  - The level of uncertainty (risk) is the highest (worst? Best?)
  - Project stakeholders have the greatest opportunity to influence the project
- **In middle phases** of a project life cycle:
  - The certainty of completing a project improves
  - More resources are needed (at the right time)
- **The final phase** of a project life cycle focuses on:
  - Ensuring that project requirements were met (how, measures and indicators)
  - The sponsor approves completion of the project

### The Importance of Project Phases and Management Reviews
- A project should successfully pass through each of the project phases in order to continue on to the next
- **Management reviews (C&M)**, also called **phase exits** or **kill points**, should occur after each phase to evaluate the project's progress, likely success, and continued compatibility with organizational goals

### Phases of the Traditional Project Life Cycle
```
Initiating → Planning → Executing & Monitoring → Closing
```

## The Context of IT Projects

- IT projects can be very diverse in terms of size, complexity, products produced, application area, and resource requirements
- IT project team members often have diverse backgrounds (??) and skill sets
  - How to solve the problems?
- IT projects use diverse technologies that change rapidly. Even within one technology area, people may be highly specialized => continuous learning (training)

### Recent Trends Affecting IT Project Management
1. **Globalization**
2. **Outsourcing**: Outsourcing is when an organization acquires goods and/or sources from an outside source. Offshoring is sometimes used to describe outsourcing from another country
3. **Virtual teams**: A virtual team is a group of individuals who work across time and space using communication technologies

### Important Issues and Suggestions Related to Globalization
- **Issues**
  - Communications (face to face Vs. video conferencing Vs. written)
  - Trust (Can I trust you. Yes, but still need written proof)
  - Common work practices (e.g., HK Vs. India Vs. Arabian Vs. US Vs. Swedish, time zones)
  - Tools
- **Suggestions**
  - Employ greater project discipline
  - Think global but act local
  - Keep project momentum going (Reward scheme Vs. punishment)
  - Use new (reliable) tools and technologies

### Outsourcing
- Organizations remain competitive by using outsourcing to their advantages, such as finding ways to reduce costs
- Project managers should become more familiar with negotiating contracts and other outsourcing issues

### Virtual Teams Advantages
1. Increasing completeness and responsiveness by having a team of workers available 24/7
2. Lowering costs because many virtual workers do not require office space or support beyond their home offices. (open offices)
3. Providing more expertise and flexibility by having team members from across the world working any time of day or night (work from home)
4. Increasing the work/life balance for team members by eliminating fixed office hours and the need to travel to work (output oriented)

### Virtual Team Disadvantages
1. Isolating team members (social relationship)
2. Increasing the potential for communications problems
3. Reducing the ability for team members to network (social network) and transfer information informally
4. Increasing the dependence on technology to accomplish work

## Project Management Tools and Techniques

- Project management tools and techniques assist project managers and their teams in various aspects of project management
- **Some specific ones include**:
  - Project charter, scope statement, and Work Breakdown Structure (scope)
  - Gantt charts, network diagrams, critical path analysis, critical chain scheduling (time)
  - Cost estimates and earned value management (cost)

### "Super Tools"
- "Super tools" are those tools that have high use and high potential for improving project success, such as:
  - Software for task scheduling (such as project management software)
  - Scope statements
  - Lessons-learnt reports
- Tools already extensively used that have been found to improve project importance include:
  - Progress reports
  - Kick-off meetings
  - Gantt charts
  - Change requests (formal)

## Defining Project Success

- What is a successful project?
- There are several ways to define project success:
  1. The project met scope, time, and cost goals
  2. The project satisfied the requirements of customer/sponsor
  3. The results of the project met its main objective, such as making or saving a certain amount of money, providing a good return on investment, or simply making the sponsors happy

### Top Ten Factors for IT Project Success
1. Executive support
2. User involvement
3. Experienced project manager
4. Clear business objectives
5. Minimized scope
6. Standard software infrastructure
7. Firm basic requirements
8. Formal methodology
9. Reliable estimates
10. Other criteria, such as small milestones, proper planning, competent staff, and ownership

## Programs, Portfolios, and PMO

### Programs vs. Projects
- **Program vs. Project**
  - A **program** is "a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually" (PMBOK® Guide, Sixth Edition)
  - A program can consist of several related projects
    - Building an airport is a large program consisting of many projects
- **Program management** focuses on the project inter-dependencies and helps to determine the optimal approach for managing them
  - Resolving resources constraints and/or conflicts that affect multiple projects within the program
  - Aligning organization/strategic direction that affect project and program goals and objectives

### Roles: Project Manager vs. Program Manager
- Project managers work with project sponsors, the project team, and other stakeholders involved in a project to meet project goals
- Program managers oversee programs; often act as bosses for project managers

### Project Portfolios
- A **portfolio** refers to a collection of projects or programs and other works that are group together to facilitate effective management of that work to meet strategic business objectives
- The projects and programs are not necessarily be interdependent or directly related
  - Example: an infrastructure firm that has strategic objective of "maximizing the return on its investment" may put together a portfolio that includes a mix of projects in oil and gas, power, roads, rail and airports
- **Portfolio managers** help their organizations make wise investment decisions by helping to select and analyze projects from a strategic perspective

### Figure 1-3. Project Management Compared to Project Portfolio Management
*(Visual comparing project, program, and portfolio management)*
- Long term vs. Short term focus

### Project Management Office (PMO)
- A **project management office (PMO)** is an organization body or entity assigned various responsibilities related to the centralized and coordinated management of those projects under its domain
- The responsibilities of a PMO can range from providing project management support functions to actually being responsible for the direct management of a project
- The projects managed by a PMO may or may not be related

### Primary Functions of PMO
1. Managing shared resources across all projects administrated by PMO
2. Identifying and developing project management methodology, best practice, and standard
3. Coaching, mentoring, training and oversight
4. Developing and managing project policies, procedures, templates, and other documentations (organizational process assets)
5. Monitoring compliance with project management standards, policies, procedures, and templates via project audits, and
6. Coordinating communication across projects

### Project Manager Vs. PMO
1. The project manager focuses on the **specific project objectives**, while PMO manages **major program scope changes** which may be seen as potential opportunities to achieve better business objectives
2. The PM controls the **assigned project resources** to best meet project objectives while the PMO optimizes the use of **shared resources** across all projects
3. The PM manages the **constraints (i.e., scope, cost and time)** of the individual project while the PMO manages the **methodologies, standards, overall risk/opportunity, and interdependencies among projects** at the enterprise level

## The Role of the Project Manager

- **Project manager** is the person assigned by the organization to achieve the project objectives
- Depending on the organizational structure, a PM may report to a functional manager. In other cases, a PM may be one of several PMs who report to a portfolio or program manager
- Job descriptions vary, but most include responsibilities like planning, scheduling, coordinating, and working with people to achieve project goals
  - Note: NOT to complete a project BUT to manage a project to complete
- Remember that 97% of successful projects were led by experienced project managers, who can often help influence success factors

### Top Ten Skills for Project Managers
1. People skills (soft skills)
2. Leadership
3. Listening
4. Integrity, ethical behavior, consistent
5. Strong at building trust
6. Verbal communication
7. Strong at building teams
8. Conflict resolution, conflict management
9. Critical thinking, problem solving
10. Understands, balances priorities
*Which one is the most important?*

### Most Important Skills & Competencies by Project Type
*(Table showing different skill priorities)*
- **Large projects**: leadership, relevant prior experience, planning, people skills, verbal communication, and team-building skills were most important
- **High uncertainty projects**: risk management, expectation management, leadership, people skills, and planning skills were most important
- **Very novel projects**: leadership, people skills, having vision and goals, self confidence, expectations management, and listening skills were most important
