# Project Risk Management
## Managing Software Projects

## The Importance of Project Risk Management

- **Project risk management** is the art and science of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk throughout the life of a project and in the best interests of meeting project objectives
  - **Science Vs. Art**
    - Science: systematic method and solution with supports
    - Art: not easy to say clearly but I know what is good and what is bad. I also know what I want under different situations
- Risk management is often overlooked in projects, but it could be highly important
  - Consider what the risks are for every decision
- **What is a risk?** The potential problems that may affect the success of your project

### The Importance of Project Risk Management
- It is IMPOSSIBLE to identify all the risks (known and unknown risks)
- Preparing to solve all the risks is IMPOSSIBLE
- Sometimes, you may feel it is a waste of money/time especially no risk occurs finally
  - Y2K problem is a risk (before 2000). What were the impacts of Y2K problem to the IT industries? UP! And then DOWN!!!

### Research Shows Need to Improve Project Risk Management
- Management considers risk management as least important
  - Why? It is difficult to anticipate and to decide the cost/benefits
  - What are the risks? I do not know. So, no risk!?
  - How much should I spend on preparing for the risks? Difficult to tell
    - Spending too much, wasting of money
- Risk has the lowest maturity rating of all knowledge areas

## Understanding Risk

### Negative Risk
- A dictionary definition of risk is "the possibility of loss or injury". This is the **negative risk**
- Negative risk involves understanding potential problems that might occur in the project and how they might affect project success
- Negative risk management is like a form of insurance; it is an investment to secure the future

### Risk Can Be Positive
- (Negative) Risks could be GOOD (similar to Challenges)
  - Even if some problems happened, if you can handle them wisely, the final result could be beneficial
  - Any examples? Learn from your previous mistakes and problems
  - After solving a difficult problem, you will build up your reputation and confidence, and also have your experiences
- **Positive risks** are the risks that result in good things happening; sometimes called opportunities
  - Note: opportunities could be BAD finally
- A general definition of project risk:
  - An uncertainty that can have a negative or positive effect on meeting project objectives
- **The goal of project risk management is thus to minimize the impacts of negative risks while maximizing the impacts of positive risks**

## Project Risk Management Processes

1. **Planning risk management (planning)**
   - Deciding how to approach and plan the risk management activities for the project

2. **Identifying risks (planning)**
   - Determining which risks are likely to affect a project and documenting the characteristics of each

3. **Performing qualitative risk analysis (planning)**
   - Prioritizing risks based on their probability and impact of occurrence

4. **Performing quantitative risk analysis (planning)**
   - Numerically estimating the effects of risks on project objectives

5. **Planning risk responses (planning)**
   - Taking steps to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to meeting project objectives

6. **Controlling risks (monitoring & controlling)**
   - Monitoring identified and residual risks, identifying new risks, carrying out risk response plans, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk strategies throughout the life of the project

## Risk Management Planning (1)

- The main output of risk management planning is a **risk management plan**, which documents the procedures for managing risk throughout a project
  - A part of project management plan
- The project team should review project documents and understand the organization's and the sponsor's approaches to risk (how much they are willing to spend)
  - Risks can be taken in different degrees depending on the company policies (sufficient measures on risk management)
  - Do we need to spend a lot?
  - Only minimal is sufficient?

### Topics Addressed in a Risk Management Plan
- **Define methodology**
  - How will risk management be performed?
  - What are the tools for risk management?
- **Define the roles and responsibilities**
  - Who will handle the risks, and their roles and responsibility?
- **Define risk categories (groups)**
- **Define the risk probability and impact** (if possible)

### Contingency & Fallback Plans, Contingency Reserves
- Other than risk management plan, we also have:
  - **Contingency plans** are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs
    - What should be done if the risk occurs?
  - **Fallback plans** are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk are not effective
    - No other choices, then go back
  - **Contingency reserves or allowances** are provisions held by the project sponsor or organization to reduce the risk of cost or schedule overruns to an acceptable level
  - **Management reserves** are funds held for unknown risks that are NOT part of the cost baseline but ARE part of the budget and funding requirements

### Common Sources of Risk in Information Technology Projects
- Several studies show that IT projects share some common sources of risk
  - Changing user requirements, lack of executive supports, inadequate planning ...

### Information Technology Projects Success Potential Scoring Sheet


### Broad Categories of Risk
- Broad categories of risk help identify potential risks
  - **Market risk**
  - **Financial risk**
  - **Technology risk**
  - **People risk**
- Remember: risks => uncertainty and potential problems/benefits

### Potential Negative Risk Conditions Associated With Each Knowledge Area
*(List of risk conditions by knowledge area)*

### What Went Wrong?
- In a 2013 survey, risk management was a high priority, but only 66 percent of companies said they often build it into their strategy planning decisions
- Airline incidents cause concerns, especially when lives are lost. The 2015 Germanwings crash resulted in 150 deaths, allegedly due to the co-pilot's poor mental state. They responded immediately by implementing a rule that two people must be in the cockpit at all times and are considering changes to medical and psychological tests for pilots

## Identifying Risks (2)

- Identifying risks is the process of understanding what potential events/problems might hurt or enhance a particular project
- **How to identify risks?**
  - No any good method. Mainly based on your experiences
  - If no ideas, look at the details and ask the experts
- **Risk identification tools and techniques include**:
  1. Brainstorming
  2. Delphi techniques
  3. Interviewing
  4. SWOT analysis

### Brainstorming
- **Brainstorming**: a group attempts to generate ideas or find a solution for a specific problem by amassing ideas spontaneously and without judgment (ad hoc)
  - An experienced facilitator should run the brainstorming session and the participants should be constructive (under control)
- Be careful not to overuse or misuse brainstorming
- Psychology literature shows that individuals produce a greater number of ideas working alone than they do through brainstorming in small, face-to-face groups
  - Find the trustable members to work with
  - Group effects often inhibit idea generation

### Delphi Technique
- **The Delphi Technique**: to derive a consensus among a panel of experts who make predictions about future developments
  - Provides independent and anonymous input regarding future events
  - Uses repeated rounds of questioning and written responses and avoids the biasing effects possible in oral methods, such as brainstorming

### Interviewing
- **Interviewing** is a fact-finding technique for collecting information in face-to-face, phone, e-mail, or instant-messaging discussions
  - Interviewing people with similar project experience is an important tool for identifying potential risks

### SWOT Analysis
- **SWOT analysis** (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can also be used during risk identification
  - Helps identify the broad negative and positive risks that apply to a project

### Risk Breakdown Structure
- A **risk breakdown structure** is a hierarchy of potential risk categories for a project
  - Similar to a work breakdown structure (WBS)
  - Use to identify and categorize risks
  - So, look at what you need to do (tasks) to consider what the potential risks are
  - Also good for communication

### Risk Register
- The main output of the risk identification process is a list of identified risks and other information needed to begin creating a **risk register**
- A **risk register** is:
  - A document that contains the results of various risk management processes and that is often displayed in a table or spreadsheet format
  - A risk register contains a list of risk events
- **Risk events** refer to specific, uncertain events that may occur to the detriment or enhancement of the project

#### Risk Register Contents
1. An identification number for each risk event
2. A rank for each risk event
3. The impact/probability of a risk event
   - Different risks may have different impacts and different probability to occur => priorities
4. The name of each risk event
5. A description of each risk event
6. The category under which each risk event falls
7. The root cause of each risk
   - The ultimate cause of a risk
8. Triggers for each risk; triggers are indicators of actual risk events
   - How to identify the occurrence of a risk?
9. Define responses to each risk
   - What to be done after a risk has occurred?
10. The risk owner who will own or take responsibility for each risk
    - Who should be responsible for handling the risk?
11. The probability and impact of each risk occurring
    - Difficult to define exactly. May use a relative value (high, low)
12. The status of each risk
    - While someone is handling a risk, what is the current status?

#### Sample Risk Register
```
• No.: R44
• Rank: 1
• Risk: New customer
• Description: We have never done a project for this organization before and don't know too much about them. One of our company's strengths is building good customer relationships, which often leads to further projects with that customer. We might have trouble working with this customer because they are new to us.
• Category: People risk
• Etc.
```

## Qualitative Risk Analysis (3)

- Identify the likelihood (probability) and impact of identified risks to determine their magnitude and priority
- **Tools and techniques** (for presentation) include:
  1. Probability/impact matrixes
  2. The Top Ten Risk Item Tracking
  3. Watch list
  4. Expert judgment

### Probability Impact Matrix
- A **probability/impact matrix** lists the relative probability of a risk occurring on one side of a matrix and the relative impact of the risk occurring on the other
  - Use simple probability indicator
  - List the risks as high, medium, or low in terms of its probability of occurrence and its impact if it did occur
  - Calculate risk factors (probability × impacts)
    - A rough estimation
  - Numbers that represent the overall risk of specific events based on their probability of occurring and the consequences to the project if they do occur

### Chart Showing High, Medium & Low Risk
*(Visual representation of risk categories)*

### Top Ten Risk Item Tracking & Watch List
- **Top Ten Risk Item Tracking** helps to identify risks and maintain an awareness of risks throughout the life of a project
  - Too many risks => concentrate on some important risks
  - Periodic review of the top ten project risk items
    - Monitoring and controlling
  - How they change in ranking? List the current ranking, previous ranking, number of times the risk appears on the list over a period of time, and a summary of progress made in resolving the risk item
- A **watch list** is a list of risks that are low priority but are still identified as potential risks

### Top Ten Risk Item Tracking
*(Sample tracking table)*

## Performing Quantitative Risk Analysis (4)

- Often follows qualitative risk analysis, but both can be done together. It gives a figure to describe a risk
  - Note: it may not be more accurate
- Large, complex projects involving leading edge technologies often require extensive quantitative risk analysis
  - Costs and benefits analysis mainly concentrate on your expected outcomes. They normally ignore an exceptions (unexpected events (risks))
- **Main techniques include**:
  1. Decision tree analysis
  2. Simulation
  3. Sensitivity analysis

### Decision Trees & Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
- A **decision tree** is used to help select the best course of action in situations in which future outcomes are uncertain
  - Look at all the possible outcomes and their probabilities
- **Estimated monetary value (EMV)**:
  - A risk event × probability
  - The risk event's monetary value
  - Calculate the expected value instead of just the value of one of the outcomes
- You can draw a decision tree to help find the EMV
  - Note: the EMV is not one of the outcomes but it is your average return from many projects

### Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
*(Calculation example)*

## Planning Risk Responses (5)

- After identifying and quantifying/qualifying risks, you must decide how to respond to them at the planning stage
- **Four main response strategies for negative risks**:
  1. **Risk avoidance**
     - Do any to reduce the probability of risk to occur
  2. **Risk acceptance**
     - Ok, I know there is a risk, but I have prepared
  3. **Risk transference**
     - Shift the responsible to a third party if it occurs, i.e., insurance
  4. **Risk mitigation**
     - Reduce the impacts of a risk if it occurs
- **Tradeoffs**: Cost and benefit analysis (if no risks occur, your investment will be wasted.)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies for Technical, Cost & Schedule Risks
*(Table showing mitigation strategies)*

### Response Strategies for Positive Risks
1. **Risk exploitation**
   - Do whatever you can to make it happens
2. **Risk sharing**
   - Share the benefits with other related parties
3. **Risk enhancement**
   - Try to maximize the benefits
4. **Risk acceptance**
   - Do nothing

### Residual and Secondary Risks
- Risks may come in a sequence
- It is also important to identify residual and secondary risks
- **Residual risks** are risks that remain after all of the response strategies have been implemented
  - Risk may not be solved totally
  - *I.e., the conflicts between two team members in doing a project*
- **Secondary risks** are a direct result of implementing a risk response
  - A change may solve the current problem but also may create a new problem
  - *I.e., Schedule risk => ask members to work overtime => quality problem*

## Controlling Risks (6)

- Once you have identified the occurrence of a risk (if it is a major one, we call it crisis) and have applied procedures to deal with the risk, you still need to monitor the risk status
- Involves executing the risk management process to respond to the risk events
- **Workarounds** are unplanned responses to risk events when there are no contingency plans
  - It is common that the risk events are unexpected
- **Main outputs of risk monitoring and control are**:
  - Risk register updates
  - Organizational process assets updates
  - Change requests
  - Updates to the project management plan and other project documents

### Results of Good Project Risk Management
- Unlike crisis management, good project risk management often goes unnoticed
  - You already spent effort to avoid a risk
- **What is the difference between a crisis and a risk?**
  - A crisis is something bad that has happened
  - A risk is a potential problem
  - Y2K problem, a risk or a crisis?
- Well-run projects appear to be almost effortless, but a lot of work goes into running a project well
  - So, the top management may have a feeling that the project is too easy and the PM has nothing important to do
- Project managers should strive to make their jobs look easy to reflect the results of well-run projects
